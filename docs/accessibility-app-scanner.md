LambdaTest offers a powerful Accessibility Scanner for native Android and iOS apps, integrated seamlessly with our manual app testing environment. This helps QA teams and developers identify accessibility issues directly during real-time testing sessions. Follow this guide to understand how to perform accessibility scans manually.

## Prerequisites
- You must have access to the LambdaTest Real Device Cloud.
- Your Android app (.apk or .aab) or iOS app should be uploaded to the platform.
- Ensure you have enabled the Accessibility feature from your account or project settings, if applicable.

## Steps to perform Accessibility Testing using the App Scanner
### Step 1: Navigate to the Accessibility Section
- Log in to your LambdaTest dashboard.
- From the left-hand menu, click on Accessibility.
- Select the **App Scanner** tab under the Accessibility tab.

### Step 2: Upload your Application
- To start accessibility testing, you need to upload your application first.
- Click on the **Upload** button to upload it from your local system.
- You can also install via Playstore or Firebase or upload via URL.

### Step 3: Launch Manual App Testing
- Choose the target Android or iOS device and select your application.
- Click on the **Start** button to launch the manual testing session on the selected device.

### Step 4: Scan the App Screens
- Once the session is started and your app is launched on the device, click on the **Start Scanning** button to start the scanning of current page.

<br />
- Interact with your app just like a real user — navigate through different screens, buttons, and views.
- The scanner will analyze the current screen and return a list of detected accessibility issues.

### Step 5: Review Accessibility Issues
After scanning, you’ll see a categorized list of issues based on severity (Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor). Each issue includes:
- Description of the accessibility problem.
- List of affected element.
- Suggested fix or recommendation.

Continue testing by navigating to additional screens in the app and scanning them one-by-one. This helps ensure that your entire app meets accessibility standards across all flows and use cases.

### Step 6: Accessibility Report
After completion of your scanning, click on the **Save Test** button.
- Go to the **Manual Reports** tab under the Accessibility tab.
- Select your desired report
- You can also share the report over email, export it in JSON, CSV and PDF format, and also you create an issue as well for that report.
