In Appium testing, assessing your app's performance under diverse network conditions (2G/3G/LTE) and offline scenarios, is crucial. Fluctuating upload and download speeds can significantly impact your app's behavior across different devices.

LambdaTest simplifies testing by enabling simulation of diverse network conditions. Whether starting with defaults or custom profiles, these features replicate real-world scenarios, proving invaluable for Appium tests. The device maintains uninterrupted internet connectivity throughout, ensuring a reliable testing experience for your mobile applications.

## Workflow
### Initialization

- **Capability:** Initiate a test session with predefined network profiles using the `networkProfile` capability. Example:
     ```python
     caps = {
        "network": True,
        "networkProfile": "2g-gprs-good"  # Set the desired network profile
    }
    ```

:::note
To utilize the **networkProfile** capability, ensure that you include `network: True` in the capabilities.
:::  

### During Test Execution

- **LambdaHook:** Dynamically alter the network profile within the test session using the following LambdaHook:
    ```python
    driver.execute_script("updateNetworkProfile=3g-umts-good")
    ```

### Supported Network Profiles

| Profile Name             | Download Speed | Upload Speed | Latency |
|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| 2g-gprs-poor             | 20 Kbps         | 6 Kbps       | 1000 ms |
| 2g-gprs-good             | 50 Kbps         | 16 Kbps      | 500 ms  |
| 3g-umts-poor             | 200 Kbps        | 64 Kbps      | 400 ms  |
| 4g-lte-poor              | 1 Mbps          | 500 Kbps     | 200 ms  |
| 3g-umts-good             | 5 Mbps          | 2 Mbps       | 100 ms  |
| 4g-lte-good              | 15 Mbps         | 7 Mbps       | 70 ms   |
| 4g-lte-advanced-good     | 25 Mbps         | 12 Mbps      | 20 ms   |
| default                  | NA             | NA           | NA      |


### Custom Profiles

- **LambdaHook:** Define and implement custom network profiles with LambdaHook by specifying the maximum download speed (kbps), maximum upload speed (kbps), and latency (ms) for the custom condition, as illustrated in the example.
    ```python
    driver.execute_script("customNetworkProfile: { \"downloadSpeed\": 500, \"uploadSpeed\" : 250, \"latency\": 100 }" )
    ```

### Default/Reset Network Configuration

- **LambdaHook:** Employ this webhook to seamlessly restore the device's network profile to its default state. Invocation of this LambdaHook removes any predefined or custom network settings, ensuring the device is reset to its original configuration.
    ```python
    driver.execute_script("updateNetworkProfile=default")
    ```

### Offline Mode

#### Android

- To initialize tests in **offline mode**, set the `networkProfile` capability to `offline` during session initiation:
    ```python
    caps = {
        "network": True,
        "networkProfile": "offline"  # Set to offline mode
    }
    ```

- **LambdaHook:** You can also switch to offline mode during the test execution with the following command:
    ```python
    driver.execute_script("updateNetworkProfile=offline")
    ```
:::note
Currently, for iOS, we do not support any capability or LambdaHook for offline mode.
:::


## Toggle Offline/Online Mode via API

- For android devices you can use the offline/online mode API as well within the running test session:

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/mobile-automation/api/v1/sessions/<session-id>/update_network' \
    --header 'Authorization: Basic <username:access_key>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"mode": "offline"}'
    ```

:::note
- **Network throttling** results may vary sometimes based on multiple factors including network conditions and device performance.4

- **Wrong Capability Name or Value:** Providing an incorrect capability value results in a bad request error with a descriptive message.

- **LambdaHook Error:** If you pass any wrong value in LambdaHook, you will receive an error message.

- In offline mode, **live video** will not be available for the duration of the iOS sessions.
