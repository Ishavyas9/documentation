## Searching and Filtering Apps
Once your apps are uploaded, you can easily search and filter them using the tools provided:

- **Search Bar**: Search by:

  - **App Name** – the name of the app you uploaded.

  - **Package Name** – the identifier for all versions of an Android app.

  - **Bundle ID** – the identifier for all versions of an iOS app.

- **OS Filter**: 
  The OS Filter in the App Manager allows you to easily sort and view apps based on their operating system. This is especially useful when managing a mix of Android and iOS builds.
  - You can filter the app list to show:

    - **Android** apps only

    - **iOS** apps only

    - Both **Android** and **iOS** apps together

## Version Control

**LambdaTest App Manager** offers a convenient version control system for managing multiple versions of the same application:
- When you click on an app name in the file bundle section, a **App Card** opens.
- This **App Card** displays all versions of the selected app that have been uploaded.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/APP_MANAGER_APP_CARD.png').default} className="doc_img"/>
- The **most recent version** appears at the top, with older versions listed below.
- Users can:
  -  **Search** through the uploaded App versions.
  -  Run any version by clicking the **Green Run** button or recent version by clicking on **Run App**.

### Release Notes for Versions
For each app version, you can add multiline release notes to help differentiate between multiple builds.
- To add release notes, open the three dots menu on the desired version in the App Card and click Version Details.
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/App_Manager_r1.png').default} className="doc_img"/>
- Inside Version Details, you’ll see an option to enter release notes.
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/App_Manager_r2.png').default} className="doc_img"/>
- Once added, a notes icon appears on the version. On hover, the release note is shown directly from the App Card. 
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/App_Manager_r3.png').default} className="doc_img"/>

:::info
