With LambdaTest App Live, you can test Apple Pay flows on **Real iOS Devices**. This guide walks you through enabling Apple Pay, configuring wallets, running the application, and completing transactions manually.

### Step 4: Use Apple Pay in App Live

Within the App Live session, you can use Apple Pay via the **Assistive Touch** option. Simply click on Apple Pay, and you will be prompted to enter the device passcode (default is `123456`). Once the passcode is entered, you can complete a payment through Apple Pay, simulating a real user transaction.
