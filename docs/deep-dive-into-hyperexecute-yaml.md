This document contains detailed explanations for all YAML flags, providing an in-depth understanding of each configuration parameter.

## Mandatory Parameters

### `version`
The version of HyperExecute YAML being used to run the tests. Currently there are two supported versions are [0.1](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#hyperexecute-yaml-parameters) and [0.2](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/). 
```yaml
version: 0.1
```

***

### `runson`
In this flag, you will define your required Operating System on which you want to run your tests.
> Currently we support linux, mac (macOS Monterey), mac13 (macOS Ventura), win (Windows 10) and win11 (Windows 11). 

```yaml
runson: linux # mac, mac13, win, win11
```

If you want to run a multi OS job, you can use [matrix method](/support/docs/hyperexecute-matrix-multiplexing-strategy/) as shown below

```yaml
runson: ${matrix.os}
matrix:
  os: [linux, mac, mac13, win, win11]
```

***

### `pre`
All actions you need to perform before each test execution, such as installing dependencies. You’ll ideally want to use this parameter to "pre" run simple commands like `npm install`, `yarn install`, `mvn install` etc

```yaml
pre:
  - npm install
  - mvn install 
```

>📘 Refer to [globalPre](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#globalpre) command to perform a common global setup for all your tasks, such as installing dependencies or configuring environments.

***
## AutoSplit Mode Parameters

<!-- AUTOSPLIT MODE STARTED-->

### `autosplit` 
Auto-Split mode automatically splits your [`scenarios`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-status/#3-stage-level-status) among the concurrent number of [`tasks`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-status/#2-task-level-status) and executes them parallelly. This ensures optimal utilization of resources and significantly reduces the overall execution time of your test suite.

For instance, if you have a concurrency of 10 and you want to run 50 tests in total, AutoSplit mode will distribute these 50 tests on 10 VMs in the most efficient manner possible to reduce your overall job execution time.

> **Note:** In [`local mode`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#mode), these commands will be smartly distributed among the VMs using history data, such that each VM (`task`) gets to run for almost the same amount of time to reduce your total [`job`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-guided-walkthrough/#jobs-page) time.

```yaml
autosplit: true   
```

> 📕 Take a closer look at the [AutoSplit mode](/support/docs/hyperexecute-auto-split-strategy/).

***

### `concurrency`
This indicates the total number of concurrent sessions that can run in parallel for processing your test-cases. Your job will have as many virtual machines [(`tasks`)](/support/docs/hyperexecute-status/#2-task-level-status) as you have defined for this flag.

> if you are using the [AutoSplit strategy](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#autosplit) then it is mandatory for you to define the concurrency.

```yaml
concurrency: 10   
```
:::tip Pro Tip
- After analyzing your test cases and usage patterns, the platform will automatically recommend the optimal concurrency settings tailored to your needs. These recommendations are displayed in the banner on the left-hand side. [Learn more here.](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-find-correct-concurrency/)
- You can see the overall concurrency trends using our [analytics widgets.](/support/docs/analytics-modules-resource-utilization/#concurrency-trends)
:::

***

### `testDiscovery`
This is used to locate or discover relevant tests via class names, filters, file names, etc. 
```yaml
testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: local
  command: grep 'public class' src/test/java/hyperexecute/*.java | awk '{print$3}'
```

It contains the following attributes: 
#### `type` 
```yaml
#(Recommended). When we are passing a command to discover tests. 
type: raw   #or

#(Advanced). For more advanced use cases.
type: automatic
```

**`type: raw`**

- **Purpose:** Perform a basic test discovery based on the provided command.
- **Functionality:** Directly executes the specified command and displays the discovered tests.
- **Limitations:** Doesn't utilize any built-in logic or advanced discovery capabilities.
- **Suitable for:** Simple test discovery scenarios where the command directly identifies the desired tests.

**`type: automatic`**

- **Purpose:** Utilize backend logic to discover tests using external tools.
- **Functionality:** Relies on a backend tool, such as Snooper, to perform test discovery.
- **Limitations:** Cannot be used directly with a command-based approach.
- **Suitable for:** Complex test discovery scenarios where advanced logic or external tools are required.

In summary, `type:raw` is a basic and straightforward approach for discovering tests based on a specified command, while `type:automatic` provides more flexibility and advanced capabilities by leveraging external tools and backend logic.

#### `mode`
This attribute defines where the test discovery occurs and how it is executed. HyperExecute now supports three discovery modes: `local`, and `remote`.

```yaml
#test discovery happens on machine where CLI is running
mode: local  #or

# test discovery happens in designated HyperExecute VMs
mode: remote
```
<!-- #test discovery happens on HyperExecute VMs
mode: dynamic #or -->
**`mode: local`**

- **Purpose:** Test discovery is performed locally on the machine where the CLI is running.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for small projects or when tests need to be discovered locally.
- **Limitations:** Requires dependencies installed locally and doesn’t support matrix-based distributions. Debugging logs are generated locally, limiting visibility.

<!-- **`mode: dynamic`**

- **Purpose:** Test discovery occurs on HyperExecute’s VMs during runtime, depending on the concurrency and OS settings.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for scenarios where distributed test discovery is required across different VMs.
- **Limitations:** Increases test execution time due to VM-level discovery. It also lacks efficient test distribution across VMs, and is incompatible with YAML 0.2 test discovery runners. -->

**`mode: remote`** <NewTag value="NEW" bgColor="#ffec02" color="#000" />

The `remote` discovery mode addresses the limitations of `local` modes. Instead of running test discovery on your local machine (local), this mode centralizes the process by using a dedicated remote Virtual Machines. 

This setup helps to ease the discovery process and makes it more efficient, especially for complex test setups. Additionally, it fully supports [matrix-based testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-matrix-multiplexing-strategy/), which allows you to discover and manage tests across different configurations more effectively.

> **NOTE :** [`type`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#type) is not required with remote discovery.

#### Key Features:
- **Centralized Discovery Tasks:** Tests are discovered remotely in a Virtual Machines designed for this purpose. Discovery tasks focus solely on identifying the tests without executing them, optimizing the discovery process.

- **Orchestration Support:** Once tests are identified, orchestration algorithms ensure they are efficiently distributed across Virtual Machines, reducing idle time and improving resource utilization.

- **Matrix Support:** Fully supports matrix configurations, allowing individual test discovery for each matrix combination, particularly useful for YAML 0.2 runners.

- **Optimized Caching:** Remote Discovery Mode reduces redundant cache operations by performing them once in the discovery task, and sharing the cache across all Execution Tasks. This speeds up the overall process and minimizes resource wastage.

- **Code Caching:** For users cloning their codebase via Git, Remote Discovery caches the code during the discovery task, reducing Git rate limits and accelerating the execution tasks.

#### `command`
The command that fetches the list of test scenario that would be further executed using the value passed in `testRunnerCommand`
```yaml
command: grep 'public class' src/test/java/hyperexecute/*.java | awk '{print$3}'
```

:::tip
- Test orchestration will happen with [`mode: local`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#mode) only.
- 📕 Learn how to perform [dependent test discovery](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-perform-dependent-test-based-discovery/).
:::

### `testRunnerCommand`
The `testRunnerCommand` used to run a single test entity in isolation. This entity could be a file, module, feature, or scenario. It is defined in the YAML file and tells the system how to run the test entity.

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="$test" -Dscenario="$test" -DOs="win 10"

# This command runs the test using Maven and passes in the options for Cucumber, the scenario to run, and the operating system to use.
```

***

## Matrix Mode Parameters

### `matrix`
The [matrix mode](/support/docs/hyperexecute-matrix-multiplexing-strategy/) allows you to run the same set of tests across multiple combinations of environments, configurations, or parameters. This is particularly useful for ensuring that your software works correctly under different conditions, such as various operating systems, browser versions, or dependency files.

```yaml
runson: ${matrix.os}

matrix:
  os: ["win", "mac", "linux"]
  version: ["latest, dev"]
  browser: ["Chrome", "Firefox"]
  files: ["@File1","@File2"]
```

***

### `exclusionMatrix`
The [exclusion matrix](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-matrix-multiplexing-strategy/#exclusion-in-matrix-strategy) allows you to omit specific combinations of parameters from being tested. For instance, if Safari on Windows is not a valid combination, you can exclude it using the exclusionMatrix parameter, ensuring that invalid or irrelevant test combinations are skipped.

```yaml
#runson defines the OS of your test execution node.
runson: ${matrix.os}

matrix:
  # Browser version(s) separated by Comma
  version: ["latest"]
  # OS name sepataed by Coma
  os: ["win", "mac", "linux"]
  # Browser name separated by Comma
  browser: ["Chrome", "Firefox", "Safari"]
  # Test Files separated by Comma
  files: ["@File1","@File2","@File3","@File4"]

exclusionMatrix: 
  - os: [win]
    browser: ["Safari"]
    files: ["@File2","@File3"]
```

***

### `combineTasksInMatrixMode`

In matrix mode, the [concurrency](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#concurrency) flag is not recognized. Therefore, in order to use the limited concurrencies that come with your license for a matrix-mode job, you need to set `combineTasksInMatrixMode` to `true`. This will run the (matrix-multiplied) combinations as scenarios in the number of HyperExecute machines that was specified in concurrency, as opposed to using one machine per matrix combination.

For example, the below-mentioned YAML snippet will generate a total of 8 scenarios, and since the concurrency is set to 2, these 8 scenarios will run in parallel on 2 HyperExecute machines. In each machine (let's say each has 4 scenarios to execute), they will be running sequentially only.

> **Total Scenarios =** *[Entries in os List] x [Entries in browser List] x [Entries in Files List]*

```yaml
concurrency: 2
combineTasksInMatrixMode: true

matrix:
   os: ["mac", "linux"]
   browser: ["edge", "brave"]
   files: ["Test1", "Test2"]
```

### `testSuites`
A command to run the tests that were mentioned in the scenario key for [matrix](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#matrix) based test execution.

```yaml
testSuites: - mvn test -Dtest=$files
```

***

## Hybrid Mode Parameters

<!-- HYBRID MODE STARTED-->

### `parallelism`
`parallelism` defines the number of virtual machines [('tasks')](/support/docs/hyperexecute-status/#2-task-level-status) to be spawned in the case of hybrid mode. If you are not defining the parallelism, then you must define operating system-specific parallelism (win, mac, and  Linux). If both are defined, then preference will be given to OS-based parallelism.

```yaml
runson: ${matrix.os}
parallelism: 2

matrix:
 os: [win, mac]
 version: [1, 2, 3]
 browser: [chrome]
```

In the above example we have total of 3 combinations for each os i.e.<br />
**For win:**<br />
  Version: 1, Browser: Chrome<br />
  Version: 2, Browser: Chrome<br />
  Version: 3, Browser: Chrome <br /><br />
**For mac:** <br />
  Version: 1, Browser: Chrome<br />
  Version: 2, Browser: Chrome<br />
  Version: 3, Browser: Chrome

So each combination will run on a parallelism provided in the yaml. Here all combinations will run on a parallelism of 2.

#### Platform specific parallelism -> `macParallelism`, `winParallelism`, and `linuxParallelism`

If you want to provide different parallelism for macOS, linux and windows. If any of the specific operating system parallelism is not present it will consider the `parallelism` as the default value.

```yaml
parallelism: 2
linuxParallelism: 2
winParallelism: 1
macParallelism: 3

matrix:
 os: [win, mac]
 version: [1, 2, 3]
 browser: [chrome]
``` 
In the above example linux combinations will run on a parallelism on 2, `windows` combinations will run on a parallelism on 1, and `mac` combinations will run on a parallelism defined of 3.

### `testRunnerCommand`
The `testRunnerCommand` used to run a single test entity in isolation. This entity could be a file, module, feature, or scenario. It is defined in the YAML file and tells the system how to run the test entity.

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="$test" -Dscenario="$test" -DOs="win 10"

# This command runs the test using Maven and passes in the options for Cucumber, the scenario to run, and the operating system to use.
```

#### Platform specific `testRunnerCommand`

In [hybrid mode](/support/docs/hyperexecute-hybrid-strategy/), you can run your tests on multiple operating system using the same yaml. You can provide different `testRunnerCommand` for macOS, linux and windows.

If any of the specific operating system `testRunnerCommand` is not present it will consider the `testRunnerCommand` as the default value.

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="$test" -Dscenario="$test" -DOs="win 10"
linuxTestRunnerCommand: mvn test `-Dcucumber.options="$test"`  `-Dscenario="$test"`   `-DOs="linux"`
winTestRunnerCommand: mvn test `-Dcucumber.options="$test"` `-Dscenario="$test"`  `-DOs="win 10"`
macTestRunnerCommand: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="$test" -Dscenario="$test" -DOs="mac"
```

***

## Basic Parameters

### `cacheKey`
It is a unique identifier that enables HyperExecute to store and retrieve cached results efficiently. HyperExecute generates a hash value for the files specified in the `cacheKey` and checks the database to see if an entry with this hash already exists.

If an entry exists and the dependencies haven't changed, HyperExecute reuses the cached directives. If no entry exists, a new one is created. Upon successful job completion, the directives are cached for future use. This process avoids redundant downloads of dependencies, ensuring faster test execution.

```yaml
cacheKey: '{{ checksum "pom.xml" }}'
```

:::tip
If you also use Windows, you can use **forward slashes** to specify the cache file's path if your file is inside one of the directories, as demonstrated below:

```yaml
cacheKey: {{ checksum "dir1/dir2/package-lock.json" }}
```
:::

### `cacheDirectories`
It is used to cache files that do not change frequently, such as dependency files for your tests (e.g., node_modules, .m2). By caching these files, HyperExecute can significantly speed up your test execution time in subsequent runs.

```yaml
cacheDirectories:
  - .m2
```

:::info
In [version 0.2 YAML](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/), the support for caching is by default, you don't have to specify any directories to cache for faster performance. For example, in Maven, we cache the entire .m2 directory in the home folder so that subsequent tasks run faster. <br />

If you add the `cacheDirectories` and `cacheKey` keys in your YAML file, then the default caching gets disabled and preference is given your specified cache.
:::
```yaml
cacheKey: '{{ checksum "pom.xml" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - .m2
```

***

### `env`
This is helpful to set environment variables on the machine and use it in your code or install dependencies to run your test cases.

```yaml
env:
  USERNAME: abc
  PLATFORM: windows
```

***

### `runtime`

The `runtime` flag is used to:
- Download and install the dependent language and framework that is needed to execute your tests.
- You can provide the language and the version you want to be installed.

:::info
Current Languages Supported: **maven, java, dotnet, node**, **ruby**, **android-sdk**, **katalon** and **python**
:::

> 📕 Check the [supported versions](/support/docs/hyperexecute-supported-languages-and-packages/) of all the languages along with the respective operating system.


```yaml
runtime:
  - language: java
    version: "11"
```

- You can also install **gauge** and **gradle** only as an additional frameworks or tools independent of the language defined.

```yaml
runtime:
  - language: java
    version: 11
    addons:
      - name: "gauge"
        version: "1.4.0"
      - name: "gradle"
        version : "7.0"
```

- You can also provide **multiple languages** and their **specified versions** that you want installed on your machine.

```yaml
runtime:
  - language: java
    version: '17'
    addons:
      - name: gauge
        version: '1.5.6'
      - name: gradle
        version: '7.6'
  - language: python
    version: '3.10'
  - language: node
    version: '16'
```

***

<!-- ### `retryOnFailure`
This allows you to configure automatic retries for failed test scenarios. When set to true (`retryOnFailure: true`), tests will be retried based on the [`maxRetries`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#maxretries) value specified. The default setting is **false**.

This feature eliminates the need to rerun the entire job to verify if a test scenario is genuinely failing or encountering an intermittent issue. By enabling `retryOnFailure`, you can promptly retry tests upon failure, helping determine if the test consistently fails or passes in subsequent attempts."

```yaml
retryOnFailure: true
``` -->

### `retryOnFailure`
The `retryOnFailure` enables automatic retries for failed test scenarios only when the [testRunnerCommand](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#testrunnercommand) itself fails. When set to `true`, the system will retry failed commands based on the [`maxRetries`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#maxretries) value defined. The default setting is `false`.

```yaml
retryOnFailure: true
```

#### 🔍 Important Behavior Notes:
- Retries are triggered only if the test command fails.
- Retries are not triggered if the command exits successfully but the test results are marked as failed by the user.

#### ✅ Use Case:
This feature helps avoid re-running the entire job to determine if a test failure is due to a genuine issue or a transient problem (e.g., flaky tests, network hiccups). By enabling `retryOnFailure`, only the failing command is retried, allowing for quicker feedback and more efficient test execution.

***

### `maxRetries`
The `maxRetries` key defines the number of retries allowed for a failed test scenario. It is used in conjunction with the `retryOnFailure` key. When `retryOnFailure` is set to true, `maxRetries` specifies how many times each test will be retried upon failure.

With `maxRetries` and `retryOnFailure`, you don't need to rerun the entire job to retry failed test scenarios. Instead, your tests are automatically retried immediately after a failure, allowing you to determine if they pass in subsequent attempts.

> You can set a value between 1 and 5 for `maxRetries`, indicating the maximum number of retries for your tests.

```yaml
retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 2
```

***

### `post`
This parameter is used for executing actions after every test execution, such as printing an output file or uploading a report via a curl API request. It's ideal for performing post-run tasks.

```yaml
post:
  - echo <some-dir>/output/output.log
  - curl https://www.example.com
```

>📘 Refer to [globalPost](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#globalpost) command to perform a common global setup for all your tasks, such as clean up tasks and or killing the environments.

***

### `report`
This allows you to generate a consolidated report across the VMs. To use this feature, provide `report: true`, and the relative path of the data where it is expected to store and generate the reports after your test execution. You can also define the type and frameworkName of the report inside `partialReports` as shown in below example.

```yaml
report: true
partialReports:
 location: target/surefire-reports/html
 type: html
 frameworkName: extent
```

It helps you to view the report on the dashboard itself. You can download the report either from the [jobs detail page](/support/docs/hyperexecute-guided-walkthrough/#job-details-page) or you can pass[`-–download-report`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/#--download-report) flag in the job triggering command from [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/).

:::info
If you want to generate multiple reports of different types [supported by HyperExecute](/support/docs/hyperexecute-job-reports/):

```yaml
partialReports:
  - location: reports/json
    type: json
    frameworkName: extent-native

  - location: target/surefire-reports
    type: html
    frameworkName: testng
```
:::

:::note
Set `defaultReport` as false in the [`framework`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/#framework) if you are using [`YAML version 0.2`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/) and you want to generate a report using `partialReports` as shown below.
```yaml
framework:
  name: maven/testng
  defaultReports: false
```
:::

#### Regex Support for Dynamic Report Paths
You can now use **glob-style wildcards `(**)`** in the location field of `partialReports` to dynamically match nested folders and custom report paths. This is especially useful when your test reports are generated inside directories that include date stamps, environment names, or other runtime variables.

Example:
```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
partialReports:
  location: reports/**/cucumber/
  # location: target/abc/**/pqr/**/cucumber-reports
  frameworkName: cucumber
  type: json
```

Ensure that your Testrunner.java file should have the complete path from where partial reports will be added. Example:

```java title="Testrunner.java"
plugin = {
    "json:target/abc/mno/pqr/xyz/cucumber-reports/CucumberTestReport.json",
    "json:target/abc/its/pqr/abc/cucumber-reports/CucumberTestReport.json"
}
```

- Understand how you can [email the generated report](/support/docs/hyperexecute-email-reports/)
- How you can generate [different types of report](/support/docs/hyperexecute-job-reports/) based on your requirements
:::

***

### `errorCategorizedOnFailureOnly`

The `errorCategorizedOnFailureOnly` flag allows you to control the behavior of error categorization after your job is executed based on the status of your stage. By default, error categorization is applied to each stage, regardless of it's status. This means that error categorization is generated for every stage, whether it succeeds or fails.

When you enable this flag as mentioned below, the error categorization will only be generated for stages that are not passed.

```yaml
errorCategorizedOnFailureOnly: true
```

***

### `errorCategorizedReport`

The `errorCategorizedReport` flag is used to export a RCA report that has been generated by the failed tests.

```yaml
errorCategorizedReport:
  enabled: true
```

> Refer to the [Error Categorized Report documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/error-categorization-report/) for detailed instructions on generating this RCA report.

***

### `jobLabel`
The `jobLabel` YAML key is used to add tags or labels to jobs. This allows you to search your jobs using the labels or tags assigned to them. 

#### Prioritize Your Job Pipeline

To prioritize your jobs, you need to add the required priority to the jobLabel key in the YAML file e.g `high`, `low`, and `'medium'`. With `'high'` priority jobs triggered first, followed by `'medium'` priority jobs and finally `'low'` priority jobs. The values are case insensitive and the default priority is 'medium'.

You can also use it along with your existing job labels like this: 
    
```yaml
jobLabel: ['chrome', 'linux', 'low']
```

***

## Advanced Parameters

### `mergeArtifacts`
It is used to combine the artifacts created under each task to one. 
```yaml
mergeArtifacts: true
```

***

### `uploadArtefacts`
It uploads the artifacts generated from running the tests, these artifacts are uploaded, preserved and can be downloaded once the job ends. 

```yaml
uploadArtefacts:

# Will upload your reports from target/site/** to HyperExecute as FinalReport
  - name: FinalReport 
    path:
    - target/site/**
  
  # Will upload your Surefire reports from target/surefire-reports/**to HyperExecute as Surefire Report
  - name: Surefire Report
     path:
     - target/surefire-reports/**
```

> You can use the flag `--download-artifacts-zip` to download the single zip file for all the artifacts that are generated.

:::caution note
The uploadArtefact flag is not currently supported for tests running with the **Espresso** or **XCUI** frameworks. Please be aware of this limitation when configuring your tests.
:::

***

### `globalPre`
The `globalPre` flag allows you to define a pre-execution step that runs once before any of your tasks starts. This flag ensures that all necessary setup tasks, such as installing dependencies, configuring environments, or initializing resources, are completed before test execution begins.

#### Functionality
- Runs before any test execution starts, ensuring the environment is properly configured.
- Executes on a separate machine (VM) or the local machine, based on the [test discovery mode](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#mode) selected.
- Useful for setup tasks, such as fetching credentials, initializing databases, or downloading required files.

#### Limitations
- This feature is supported in YAML version 0.1 and 0.2 only.
- `remote` mode is not supported for **XCUI** and **Espresso** framework jobs. Default mode for these frameworks is `local`.

```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
globalPre:
  mode: remote #local or remote
  commands:
    - "echo 'Setting up environment'"
    - "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl"
    - "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/init"
  runson: win
  cache: true
```
<!-- 
:::info
You can also use `beforeAll` as an alias for the `globalPre` command:

```yaml
beforeAll:
  commands:
    - "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl"
  mode: remote
  runson: win
  cache: true
```
::: -->

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| mode | string | Defines where the pre-step commands will be executed. <br /> Options: [local or remote](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#mode). Default `mode` is `remote`.|
| commands | list | List of shell commands to execute before test execution begins. |
| runson | string | It specifies the operating system on which all the task would run in case of `remote mode`. By default, it is set to `linux`. |
| cache | boolean | It is used to cache the payload after all commands have executed. It is useful in cases like: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If you want to made some modification in the payload at runtime by executing some set of commands. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If the payload is fetched from git source. By caching the payload, git rate limiting can be avoided as the payload will only be fetched once per job with `cache: true`. |

#### Difference between `globalPre` and `pre` flags
| Scenario | globalPre | pre |
|----------|-----------|-----|
|Purpose | Global setup (e.g., install dependencies, initialize environment) | Task-specific setup (e.g., prepare test data) |
|Execution Frequency | Executes once per entire test execution | Executes once per task |
|Execution Location | Separate VM or local machine | Inside the task environment |
|Example Usage | `apt-get update`, `docker pull` |	`export ENV=staging` |

***

### `globalPost`
The `globalPost` flag defines a post-execution step that runs once after all tasks have completed. This step ensures that cleanup tasks, such as removing temporary files, logging results, or notifying external systems, are performed after test execution.

#### Functionality
- Runs after all test execution is completed, ensuring final cleanup and reporting.
- Executes on a separate machine (VM) or the local machine, based on the mode selected.
- Useful for cleanup tasks, such as deleting test artifacts, summarizing reports, or deallocating cloud resources.

#### Limitations
- This feature is supported in YAML version 0.1 and 0.2 only.
- `remote` mode is not supported for **XCUI** and **Espresso** framework jobs. Default mode for these frameworks is `local`.

```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
globalPost:
  mode: remote #local or remote
  commands:
    - "echo 'Cleaning up test environment'"
    - "rm -rf /tmp/test-results"
    - "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/cleanup"
  runson: linux
```

<!-- :::info
You can also use `afterAll` as an alias for the `globalPost` command:

```yaml
afterAll:
  commands:
    - "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/cleanup"
  mode: local
  runson: linux
```
::: -->

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| mode | string | Defines where the post-step commands will be executed. <br /> Options: [local or remote](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#mode). Default `mode` is `remote`. |
| commands | list | List of shell commands to execute after test execution completes. |
| runson | string | It specifies the operating system on which all the task would run in case of `remote mode`. By default, it is set to `linux`. |

#### Difference between `globalPost` and `post` flags
| Scenario | globalPost |	post |
|----------|------------|------|
|Purpose | Global cleanup (e.g., remove logs, finalize reports) | Task-specific cleanup (e.g., delete temporary files) |
|Execution Frequency | Executes once after all tasks complete | Executes once per task |
|Execution Location | Separate VM or local machine | Inside the task environment |
|Example Usage | `rm -rf /logs`, `curl -X POST …` |	`rm -rf temp/*` |

***

### `captureScreenRecordingForScenarios`
If this key is set to true, it will record whole scenario execution, and then video is accessible from your HyperExecute dashboard.
This can be majorly used for non selenium based tests to have the recorded video of the whole scenario.
```yaml
captureScreenRecordingForScenarios: true
```

:::warning info
To avoid test failures, ensure the `video` capability is `false` before enabling the `captureScreenRecordingForScenarios` flag in your YAML file. If both `video` capability and `captureScreenRecordingForScenarios` flag is set to `true` simultaneously, the tests will fail. To prevent this conflict, always pass the capability `video: false` in your tests.
:::

***

### `skipArtifactStageIfNoTest`
It is used to gracefully handle the scenario stage inside the tasks in which there are no selenium/cdp tests executed. Instead of marking the artifact stage as failed (if artifacts are not found at the defined location, HyperExecute marks it as failed) and hence the task and job as failed, the stage would be marked as skipped and hence task and job as skipped. 

```yaml
skipArtifactStageIfNoTest: true
```

***

### `globalTimeout` 

The `globalTimeout` value determines the maximum duration (in minutes) of a Job . It can be set between 1 and 150 minutes, and has a default value of 90 minutes. 

For example, if you set the `globalTimeout` to 120 minutes, a Job  that exceed this duration will be automatically terminated. If you’re expecting that running all your test-cases despite parallelism is going to take more than 90 mins, set it to an appropriate value, for example, 120. If you have tests that run for longer than the maximum limit of 150 minutes, you need to get in touch with our support team.
```yaml
globalTimeout: 90   
```

***

### `failFast`
FailFast feature allows you to stop running your tests in case there is a series of tests failure. failFast flag can be used to abort your job if the number of consecutive test failures for that job(jobID) across multiple tasks equals or exceeds the **maxNumberOfTests** value. 

```yaml
failFast:
  maxNumberOfTests: 2
```
In case retryOnFailure flag is enabled in yaml, then there will be multiple retries for a failed test. In that case, only the failure of last retry will be considered to increment the test failure count.

:::info
To apply `failFast` at the **scenario** level instead of the default test level, set the `level: scenario` in the YAML configuration.

```yaml
failFast:
  maxNumberOfTests: 2
  level: scenario
```
:::

> **NOTE :** You can specify `failFast` at either the test level or scenario level, depending on your requirements. Both configurations will work, but can lead to unexpected results, only one should be used at a time.

***

### `base`
This feature allows you to use one YAML as a base for another YAML file. By inheriting the configurations of the base (or parent) YAML file, you don't need to specify those fields in the inheriting (child) file again. [Learn more](/support/docs/hyperexecute-inherit-config/).

```yaml
base:
  yamls:
    - ./<baseConfiguration1.yaml>
    - ./<baseConfiguration2.yaml>
```

***

### `sourcePayload`
You can use this flag to use to define the source of your test scripts so that the scripts can directly be fetched from your git directly for execution on HyperExecute. Your test code is directly sourced from your Git provider with the help of secure access tokens and only your HyperExecute YAML file is encrypted and uploaded through the HyperExecute CLI. To learn more about how this feature works, go through [this page](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-configure-sourcePayload/).

```yaml
sourcePayload:
  platform: git
  link: https://--------
  ref: master
  accessToken: <your_personal_access_token>
  commit: <optional>
```

***

### `hostsOverride`
This field allows you to add domain mappings which are required to be added in the local DNS entry represented by the /etc/hosts file. This is required if you want to map a custom domain name to an ip (local or otherwise) so that any requests on this domain name resolves to the provided ip on HyperExecute machines where your tests are running. For instance, suppose for a domain "example.com", global DNS is having the entry which resolves the network call to the public IP address. With hostsOverride flag you can explicitly route the network call to a local IP address, instead of allowing the call to go through a public IP address.

```yaml
hostsOverride:
  - host: example.com
    ip: 127.0.0.1
  - host: example1.com
    ip: 127.0.0.1
```

***

### `frameworkStatusOnly`
Set status of scenario based on framework tests status. For instance, if you run a job where the framework uses lambda hooks to mark the status of tests and you want the status of the scenario to be based on the status of the tests, you need to set `frameworkStatusOnly : true` in the yaml. This flag will consider the status of the tests and will use this status to mark the status of scenarios giving you the ability to control the status of stages based on test status.

***

### `testSuiteTimeout`
It is used to set the timeout on all scenario  stages in a task. If defined, your complete test suite should get executed within this time. Its max value is 150 minutes.  If you want to increase this time beyond the default maximum limit of 150 minutes, you need to contact the support team.
```yaml
testSuiteTimeout: 30   
```
In the above example, your scenario  stage should finish within 30 mins otherwise the `task` and Job  would get marked as **timed out** after 30 minutes of execution.

***

### `testSuiteStep`
It is used to timeout individual scenario stages in a task. Each scenario in separate tasks should get completed before this time.  If you want to increase this time beyond the default maximum limit of 150 minutes, you need to contact the support team.

```yaml
testSuiteStep: 15   
```
In the above example, if any of your scenario stages take more than 15 minutes to execute, then it will get **timed out** .

***

### `retryOptions`

Regular Expressions provides more granular control over when test retries are triggered. You can achieve this through **`retryOptions`** flag.

- You can specify precise error patterns using regular expressions to determine which errors should initiate retries.
- It works seamlessly with Cypress, CDP, and Selenium framework tests.
- It is supported in both YAML 0.1 and 0.2

#### Configuration:

- Set `retryOnFailure: true` to activate the retry feature.
- Indicate the maximum number of retry attempts with `maxRetries: <number>`.
- Within the `retryOptions` section, create an `errorRegexps` array to list the regular expressions that represent the errors you want to trigger retries.

```yaml
retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 3
retryOptions:
  errorRegexps: ["org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException"]
```

***

### `preDirectives`
This is an advanced version of `pre` where you can control **how** your pre commands should be executed in a parallel HyperExecute `Task`. If both pre and preDirectives flags are provided at the same time, then the precedence is given to the preDirectives flag.
preDirectives currently has the ability to take the following additional inputs:
- `maxRetries`: You can retry the commands that failed in the pre-step by using this directive. The numerical value assigned to this field determines the amount of times you can retry the failed pre commands.
- `commands`: The actual commands that needs to run like `npm install` or `mvn install`
- `shell`: shell to execute the commands under. This is typically helpful if you want to run your pre commands in a specific shell. For example, `powershell` for Windows or `bash` for Linux and MacOS.
- `workingDirectory`: This specifies the location of the directory in which all test discovery and execution commands will run, as well as the location of any files or directories that are created as a result of the command execution.

```yaml
preDirectives:
    commands: ['mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=./.m2 dependency:resolve', sleep 60]
    maxRetries: 0
    shell: ""
    workingDirectory: ""
```

***

### `postDirectives`
This is an advanced version of `post` where you can control "how" your post commands should be executed in a parallel HyperExecute Executor. If both post and postDirectives flags are provided at the same time, then the precedence is given to the postDirectives flag.

postDirectives currently has the ability to take the following additional inputs:

- `commands`: actual commands that needs to run like `echo <some-dir>/output/output.log`
- `shell`: shell to execute the commands under. This is typically helpful if you want to run your post commands in a specific shell. For example, `powershell` for Windows or `bash` for Linux and MacOS. (Coming Soon)
- `workingDirectory`: This specifies the location of the directory in which all test discovery and execution commands will run, as well as the location of any files or directories that are created as a result of the command execution.

```yaml
postDirectives:
    commands: [cat yaml/linux/v1/testng_hyperexecute_autosplit_sample.yaml]
    shell: ""
    workingDirectory: ""
```

***

### `alwaysRunPostSteps`

**Problem :** Test scenarios failing led to the cancellation of post-steps, being unable to upload reports, and other actions that you need to perform after all test executions.

**Solution :** The `alwaysRunPostSteps` flag ensures that post-steps execute even if the scenario stage fails.

```yaml
alwaysRunPostSteps: true
```

***

### `project`

This flag is used to set the Name of your Projects which would later allow you to see all jobs of that Project at one place. To know more about Projects [click here](/support/docs/hyperexecute-projects).

```yaml
project:
  name: 'demo-project' #project name
```

:::info note
Once you have created a project, you can either pass in your `project ID` or `project name` to trigger your job on the same project.

```yaml
project:
  name: 'demo-project' #project name
  id: '1abc2345-56de-7890-f1cg-h2ij34k56789' #project id
```

***

### `differentialUpload`

When you are working with relatively large codebases, and constantly updating and upgrading your test scripts. Getting them onto the HyperExecute platform for every run might consume extra time.

To overcome this challenge, you can use `differentialUpload` flag, which is used to minimize the time taken to upload the codebase, especially when there are incremental changes.

This flag optimizes codebase uploads by **fetching** only the parts of the codebase that have been **updated** or **newly added**, significantly **reducing upload times**.

- **enabled (boolean):** Set to true to activate the optimization, and false to maintain the default behavior.

- **ttlHours (integer):** Specifies the Time-To-Live (TTL) for the uploaded code. Users can control the duration for which the optimized upload remains active, with valid values ranging from 1 hour to 360 hours.

When you pass the `differentialUpload` flag, it ensures that whenever you upload the **same codebase a second time with less than 75% changes, only the modified or new parts are fetched**. The rest is mapped to the previously uploaded version of the codebase. This approach is beneficial in scenarios where network issues or a large codebase contribute to slow upload times.

> **NOTE:** The default value for **ttlHours** is 60 hours

```yaml
project:
  name: XYZ Name
differentialUpload:
  enabled: #true/false
  ttlHours: #int value, with possible range of values [1 hour to 360 hours]
```

:::info
If the project flag is not passed then the name for the project will be set to **"Default Project"**.
:::

By activating this feature, you can experience a significant reduction in upload times, enhancing the efficiency of running and debugging multiple jobs on HyperExecute.

### `linkValidity`

The **`linkValidity`** flag is used to customize the duration of validity for report and artifact URLs generated after job completion. Currently URLs are inherently valid for 48 hours post-generation but you can tailor the validity period to align with the specific requirements, ensuring you can access the associated resources within the defined timeframe. 

> **Note:** If `linkValidity` is not defined or 0, then the default link validity to access the artifacts and reports is 2 days. The maximum validity is 60 days.

```yaml
report: true

partialReports:
  location: target/surefire-reports/html
  type: html
  frameworkName: extent
  email:
    to:
      - johndoe@example.com
    linkValidity: 5
```

```yaml
uploadArtefacts:
  - name: ExecutionSnapshots
    path:
      - <path of artifact>
    email:
      to:
        -
      linkValidity: 5
```

***

### `stripParentDirectory`
When mergeArtifacts is true, providing this flag will strip the parent directory from all the downloaded artifacts and place the artifacts in the base path.
```yaml
stripParentDirectory: true
```

***

### `generateArtifactAfterEveryStage`
With this flag artifacts will be generated after every stage,without this flag artifacts are generated after every task and avoid any overrides for artifacts of the same name. 
``` bash
generateArtifactAfterEveryStage: true
```

***

### `taskIdentifierInNonConflictingArtifacts`
This flag when set to **true** specifies that the task ID should be included in the non-conflicting artifacts. The non-conflicting artifacts are those artifacts that can be safely shared between tasks. By default, the task ID is not included in the non-conflicting artifacts.

- When the `taskIdentifierInNonConflictingArtifacts` flag is set to **true** and the `mergeArtifacts` flag is also set to **true**, the task ID will be appended to all the filenames of artifacts. This is done to ensure that the artifacts can be uniquely identified.

- For example, if you have a task that creates a file called index.html, and the `taskIdentifierInNonConflictingArtifacts` flag is set to **true**, the file will be renamed to **index.html.task-id**. This ensures that the file can be uniquely identified, even if it is merged with other files called index.html from other tasks.

```yaml
mergeArtifacts: true
taskIdentifierInNonConflictingArtifacts: true
```

- If the `taskIdentifierInNonConflictingArtifacts` flag is set to **false** and the `mergeArtifacts` flag is set to **true**, the task ID will only be appended to the filename if the filename already exists. This is done to avoid appending the task ID to the filename of an artifact that already exists.

- For example, if you have a task that creates a file called index.html, and the `taskIdentifierInNonConflictingArtifacts` flag is set to **false**, the file will not be renamed. However, if you have another task that also creates a file called index.html, the second task will rename its file to **index.html.task-id**

```yaml
mergeArtifacts: true
taskIdentifierInNonConflictingArtifacts: false
```

***

### `smartGrid`
If enabled, it will try to reduce the browser setup time [currently only for windows]. Default value is false.

```yaml
smartGrid: true
```

After a test is run, it caches the browser name, version, and all the capabilities used for this particular state and test case.
When running a test case, it tries to fetch from cache, which browser was used for the next stage in the previous run, and launches that browser in the background. This makes sure that, when the next test is run, the browser session is already running.

If you feel that browser setup time is more than expected, you should enable this feature. However, please note that it will reduce the browser setup time of the next test only if the current test takes enough time to launch the browser for the next test in background.

This would work only for `version 0.1` and local discovery mode.

As this is dependent on the previous run of a job, any change in the browser capability or test name or test order might render the cache invalid. And browser setup time reduction might not be visible in this run, rather, it would appear in the next run.

> **Note** : Currently this is available for Windows - edge, firefox, chrome - recent 5 versions. Linux and MAC are not supported currently.

***

### `scenarioCommandStatusOnly`
When enabled, it will mark the scenario as passed even if no test is associated with it or will mark the status of scenario based on the status of the scenario executed.
This can be utilised for advanced use cases where teams want to define status in HyperExecute platform based on there needs of custom frameworks. 

There are two scenarios associated with it:

#### Scenario 1: When Sessions do not open up for certain scenarios:
-  For certain scenarios that do not open up a session hence no tests are associated with that scenario, because of this the scenario gets marked as skipped and the task as partially completed. Need a way to mark those scenarios as completed/passed instead of skipped and see a green tick instead of a grey tick.

**Solution :** When `scenarioCommandStatusOnly` is set `true` in YAML, it will mark the task as passed even though no test is associated to it. In the given screenshot **task 8** is passed even though no test is associated to it.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/yaml/scenario-1.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/>

#### Scenario 2: When test cases are run n no of times:
- Some times a user might runs some test cases n no of times inherently due to framework retries etc.  Those test cases are considered as separate entries for us, and if one fails, scenario is marked as failed and hence the task and job is marked as fail. Need a way to update status of the task as if a test case first fails and then passes, it should be shown as passing and with green tick. Currently it shows as failed.

**Solution :** When `scenarioCommandStatusOnly` is set `true` in YAML, it will mark the status of scenario as passed.

 Test | Edge Case | Working Case |
|:---|:--|:---|
| Test 1 | Passes | Passes |
| Test 2 | Failed | Failed |
| Test 2 Retry - (Actually Test 3 for us) | Failed  | Passes |
| Test 3 | Passes  | Passes |
| Final Status of Stage | Failed  | Success |

As seen in the screenshot, when one of the tests is marked as failed while the other tests are marked as passed, the overall scenario is marked as passed.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/yaml/scenario-2.jpeg').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/>

### `cypress`
This option signifies that the test suite is a cypress test suite and should be pass as true in case of cypress suite.

```yaml
cypress: true
```

***

### `cypressOps`
This parameter is used to pass cypress specific options from the CLI. [Learn more](/support/docs/cypressv10-on-hyperexecute/) 

Additional options include:
- **Dedicated Proxy**: This is a boolean parameter to be passed in cypressOps. When  enabled user’s traffic will be passed to a dedicated proxy server, this feature has to be enabled from customer support team.
- **Network**: This is  a boolean parameter which when set to true enables network proxy logs for the test.
- **GeoLocation**: This parameter is used to pass the test traffic through a specific geolocation. Value to be passed here is geolocation code
- **FullHar**: This flag generates the HAR logs that offer a comprehensive view of your application's network activity during testing.
- **reporterConfigFile**: If your Cypress project does not have a custom reporter configured, `reporterConfigFile` will automatically enable command logs using the mochawesome reporter by default.
- **ProjectName**: You can define your project name to autocreate your project in the HyperExecute dashboard.

```yaml
cypressOps:
  Build: "Hyperexecute Cypress Sample Build"
  Tags: ["Hyperexecute","Cypress", "Windows", "Matrix"]
  BuildTags: ["Hyperexecute-Cypress"]
  Network: true
  FullHar: true
  geoLocation: IN
  reporterConfigFile: "reporter_config.json",
  ProjectName: "Cypress_Project"
```

***

### `shell`
Shell defines the shell/terminal type on which all of the commands defined under pre, post, testRunnerCommand mentioned in yaml should run. If shell is also defined under PreDirectives then for PreDirectives command that shell would be used.
```yaml
shell: bash
```

***

### `dataJsonPath`
DataJsonPaths helps to distribute data/configs over the VMs. In this you can create a json files and put configurations/data required for your suite as json array inside the file. For example:

```yaml
[
 { 
  "Username": "user1",
  "Password": "pass1"
 },
 {
  "Username": "user2", 
  "Password": "pass2"
 }
]
```

To access the data from the JSON files, there are primarily 2 methods:

#### 1. By reading the JSON file

In the JSON file, we have a data object and not an array of objects, hence you can directly read the data from the file.

```yaml
{
  "Username": "user1",
  "Password": "pass1" 
}
```

#### 2. Using via env variables

You can use the env variables to access the defined parameters as:

```yaml
STATIC_DATA_1_<ParameterName>
```
> **NOTE:-** In the above syntax, **1** represents the file passed in the yaml file and not the data object within the file.

For instance, to access data from **file1.json**, the syntax would be:
```
STATIC_DATA_1_Username
```

Similarly, to access the data from the second file i.e **file2.json**:
```
STATIC_DATA_2_Username
```

***

### `dataJsonBuilder`
The `dataJsonBuilder` flag in the HyperExecute YAML file is used to facilitate efficient and distributed test execution by processing JSON data. It reads JSON data from a specified file, applies optional filters, and indexes the JSON objects based on a defined key. This ensures that the data is prepared and distributed according to the testing requirements, optimizing test execution across multiple environments.

```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
dataJsonBuilder:
  path: <path_to_json_file>
  index: <indexing_key>
  filters:
    query: <filter_query>
    attributes:
      - key: <attribute_key>
        values: [<value1>, <value2>, ...]
```

#### Configuration
- **path (required) :** Specifies the path to the JSON file containing the data. Example:
  ```yaml
  path: data/file/abc.json
  ```
- **index (optional) :** Specifies the JSON key on which the indexing is required. Example:
  ```yaml
  index: username
  ```
- **filters (optional) :** Applies filtering on the JSON objects before indexing. Either `query` or `attributes` can be used, if both are mentioned then the `attributes` will have higher precedence.
  - **query:** These are used for more complex filtering operations. If both attributes and queries are provided, attributes take precedence. This means that if there’s a conflict, the filter based on attributes will be used. Example:
    ```yaml
    query: (username == "abc" or username == "bcd")
    ```
  - **attributes:** These are key-value pairs used for filtering. You can provide a list of attributes with their corresponding values, and the filtering will include only those JSON objects where each specified attribute matches one of the provided values. Attributes are applied with an "AND" logic between different keys and an "OR" logic within the same key. Example:
    ```yaml
    attributes:
      - key: username
        value: ["abc", "bcd"]
      - key: tags
        values: ["@x", "@y"]
    ```

#### Working of `dataJsonBuilder`

- The **input JSON data** should follow this format:
  ```javascript title="sample.json"
  [
    {
      "accesskey": "jhscuystc7ewgucu79as8yc9",
      "username": "abc",
      "tags": "@x"
    },
    {
      "accesskey": "cjdy87328yeiqhd93urd28hh",
      "username": "bcd",
      "tags": "@y"
    },
    {
      "accesskey": "jhscuystc7ewgucu79as8yc9",
      "username": "abc",
      "tags": "@y"
    },
    {
      "accesskey": "cjdy87328yeiqhd93urd28hh",
      "username": "bcd",
      "tags": "@a"
    }
  ]
  ```

- **`dataJsonBuilder`** flag passed in the HyperExecute YAML file:

  ```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
  dataJsonBuilder:
    path: sample.json
    filters:
      attributes:
        - key: username
          values: ["abc", "bcd"]
        - key: tags
          values: ["@x", "@y"]
  ```

- The **filtered JSON data** will be:
  ```javascript title="sample.json"
  [
    {
      "accesskey": "jhscuystc7ewgucu79as8yc9",
      "username": "abc",
      "tags": "@x"
    },
    {
      "accesskey": "cjdy87328yeiqhd93urd28hh",
      "username": "bcd",
      "tags": "@y"
    },
    {
      "accesskey": "jhscuystc7ewgucu79as8yc9",
      "username": "abc",
      "tags": "@y"
    }
  ]
  ```
The objects with **usernames** `"abc"` and `"bcd"` and **tags** `"@x"` and `"@y"` are selected as they meet the criteria defined by the attributes filter.

#### Indexing and Test Case Distribution:
After filtering, the JSON data is indexed to distribute test cases. Here’s how the distribution works:
- **VM Allocation:** Each filtered JSON object corresponds to a separate VM. If the filtered JSON contains 3 objects, 3 VMs are allocated.
- **Test Case Distribution:** Test cases are then distributed across these VMs. For each VM, test cases are distributed based on the `username` present in the filtered JSON objects. All test cases related to the same `username` are assigned to the VMs containing that `username`.

So as per the above filtered JSON data:

- **VM1** will receive all test cases related to `username: "abc"`
  ```javascript
  {
    "accesskey": "jhscuystc7ewgucu79as8yc9",
    "username": "abc",
    "tags": "@x"
  }
  ```

- **VM2** will receive all test cases related to `username: "bcd"`.
  ```javascript
  {
    "accesskey": "cjdy87328yeiqhd93urd28hh",
    "username": "bcd",
    "tags": "@y"
  }
  ```

- **VM3** will handle the JSON object:
  ```javascript
  {
    "accesskey": "jhscuystc7ewgucu79as8yc9",
    "username": "abc",
    "tags": "@y"
  }
  ```

Test cases related to `username: "abc"` will be split between **VM1** and **VM3**, while test cases related to `username: "bcd"` will be handled by **VM2**.

#### Use Cases
- **Filtering and Indexing :** When both filtering and indexing are required, filters are applied first, followed by indexing of the filtered results.
  ```yaml
  dataJsonBuilder:
    path: data/file/abc.json
    index: username
    filters:
      #either query or attributes can be used, if both are mentioned then the attributes will have higher precedence.
      query: (username == "abc" or username == "bcd")
      attributes:
        - key: username
          values: ["abc", "bcd"]
  ```

- **Only Filtering :** If only filtering is required without indexing, omit the index key. In this case, no indexing will occur, and each JSON object will be distributed in a round-robin manner among parallel executions.
  ```yaml
  dataJsonBuilder:
    path: data/file/abc.json
    filters:
      query: (username == "abc" or username == "bcd")
  ```

- **Only Indexing :** If only indexing is required without filtering, omit the filters section.
  ```yaml
  dataJsonBuilder:
    path: data/file/abc.json
    index: username
  ```

:::note
You can access the data on the machines using environment variables: `${STATIC_DATA_1_username}` - for the **username** key
:::

***

### `strict`
If strict is set to true in yaml then the variables used in yaml must be present in either vars or environment variables on the user machine. If not present then only a warning is displayed. But in case of strict: true, the execution will throw an error.

***

### `cacheTestURL`
It enables you to cache static test files in the browser.
```yaml
cacheTestURL: true
```

In case your test, loads some URLs which can be cached but the server or browser’s configuration prevents these static files from being cached in the browser, you can enable `cacheTestURL` in these cases.

For instance, 
if your test loads jquery static library multiple times and for some reason it is getting downloaded each time. Enable `cacheTestURL` to cache it. It will decrease file load time from the second time onwards.

> **Note**: These cached resources are not yet shared across VMs. So, each VM has its own copy of cache.

***

### `afterAll`
> This flag is deprecated, instead use [`globalPost`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#globalpost)

It is used to run commands after the job has finished. Currently only local directive is allowed, means that all the commands would be run on the same host on which HyperExecute CLI was run. Running commands in `afterAll` on HyperExecute VMs(remote commands) is not yet supported. Users will have access to all the artifacts when these commands would be run.
```yaml
afterAll:
 local:
   commands:
   - stitch-artifacts.sh artifacts-directory
```

For instance you want to further process the artifacts and create a custom PDF. You can use `afterAll` for this purpose wherein custom commands can be invoked. Other use cases can be in case you :
- Want to run some commands after the job is finished.
- Want to run these commands from the same host from which hyperexecute-cli is run.

***

## `beforeAll`
> This flag is deprecated, instead use [`globalPre`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#globalpre)

BeforeAll is used for running pre operations like discovery and payload_update. It can be executed either on local system or on hyperexecute beforeAll VM. 
```yaml
beforeAll:
  location: local/remote 
  type: discovery/update_payload
  local: 
    commands:
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
We can choose to run on local/remote(on HYP Vms) from the location command. Type can be either discovery/update_payload (type of operation to be performed) and commands will have all the commands that needs to be run for that operation.

***

### `afterEachScenario`
The `afterEachScenario` flag is used to define tasks that should be executed after each test scenario. This can be particularly useful for cleanup activities, such as clearing cookies, resetting databases, or capturing logs, ensuring that each test scenario starts with a clean state. This flag allows you to specify a list of commands or scripts that will run sequentially after the completion of each scenario. This ensures that any necessary teardown steps are consistently applied, maintaining the integrity and isolation of your test scenarios.

```yaml
afterEachScenario:
  - echo "Running a script"
  - pwsh run.test
```

***

### `buildConfig`

This is used to manage hyperlink behavior based on test status. Here's a breakdown of the parameters within buildConfig:

  - **`buildPrefix`**: This parameter sets a custom prefix for dynamically generated build names. The format employs $&lbrace;name&rbrace; as a placeholder, which will be replaced with a specific value during configuration.

  - **`buildName`**: This parameter allows you to define a specific name for the build. Similar to buildPrefix, $&lbrace;name&rbrace; acts as a placeholder for a custom value.

  ```yaml
  buildConfig:
    buildPrefix: myCustomBuildPrefix-${name}
    buildName : "name=${name}"
  ```


  > The value for `${name}` in the above command can be passed through the vars command either by the [CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/#--vars) as mentioned below or through [YAML](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#vars).

  <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/getting_started/guided-walkthrough/17.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

:::info Dynamic Build Naming via CLI

If you prefer to set `buildPrefix` and `buildName` values through the command-line interface (CLI), the following commands can be used:

To set `buildPrefix`:
```yaml
--labels buildPrefix --vars "name=xyz"
```

To set `buildName`:

```yaml
--labels buildName --vars "name=xyz"
```

These commands utilize `--labels` to specify the parameter being configured and `--vars "name=xyz"` to define the value to be replaced for `${name}`.
:::

#### Key Pointers

- #### Build Configuration Handling:

  If `buildConfig` is not provided, then the `build_id` column within the job table remains empty. When you specify the `buildConfig`, it populates the `build_id` column with the corresponding value.

- #### Build Configuration Precedence:

  When both `buildConfig` and the `build` capability are defined, `buildConfig` takes priority.

- #### Priority of Build Naming Parameters:

  If both `buildConfig.buildName` and `buildConfig.buildPrefix` are specified, preference is given to `buildPrefix`.

- #### Association with Build Name:

  Defining `buildName` associates test results with the designated name, enabling organized tracking and management.

- #### Dynamic Build Creation:

  Specifying `buildPrefix` results in the creation of a new build for each executed job. The build name format follows **buildPrefix-&lbrace;jobID&rbrace;** to ensure uniqueness.

- #### Compatibility of Build Naming Variables:

  Both `buildPrefix` and `buildName` are compatible with vars and can be used together or independently based on your requirements.

***

### `captureCSVResult`
By enabling the boolean yaml directive `​​captureCSVResult`,  you can get the statistics of the time taken by Selenium Commands run across the job. It will gather the time taken by the Selenium commands, calculate the aggregated info for the statistics like Average, 95, 99 percentiles etc and publish it in the form of a separate artifact.
```yaml
captureCSVResult: true
```

Below mentioned custom Lambda hooks are also required to be added in the Selenium script:
lambda-start-timer=&lt;some_label&gt;
lambda-end-timer=&lt;some_label&gt;
These custom lambda hooks are basically used to track the amount of time taken by the Selenium command.

Above performance stats artifact would be of the CSV format with headers as Label, Average, Min, Max, Median, P95, P99.
Here is a brief information about these headers:
1. **Label**: Identifier passed in the custom lambda hook to identify the Selenium command
2. **Average**: Average time taken by the Selenium command across the whole job
3. **Min**: Minimum time taken by the Selenium command across the whole job
4. **Max**: Maximum time taken by the Selenium command across the whole job
5. **Median**: Median of the time taken by the Selenium command across the whole job
6. **P95**: 95th percentile of the time taken by the Selenium command across the whole job
7. **P99**: 99th percentile of the time taken by the Selenium command across the whole job

Here is the sample code showing how we can use the above mentioned Lambda hooks:
```yaml
((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-start-timer=t1");

  /* Add 5 items in the list */
  Integer item_count = 15;
  for (int count = 1; count <= item_count; count++)
  {
      /* Enter the text box for entering the new item */
      elem_new_item.click();
      elem_new_item.sendKeys("Adding a new item " + count + Keys.ENTER);
      Thread.sleep(2000);
  }
  Object t1 =  ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-end-timer=t1");
  System.out.println(t1);
```

> **Note**: t1 will denote the time taken by each selenium command between start and end.

***

### `matrixEnvPrefix`
When we run a job in matrix mode, we set the keys with their resolved value as env variables in the scenario being run. The keys are not prefixed and hence, in some cases, we had found out that some variables like "os" can affect your test runs (for example in dotnet build commands). So, if one has an `os` key in `matrix`, it may affect `dotnet build` command if one doesn’t set the matrixEnvPrefix: true in yaml to have the "os" key of matrix available to us as `HE_ENV_os

***

### `dynamicAllocation`
When we set dynamicAllocation true, the test cases are distributed among parallels at the runtime. This is valid in case of local test discovery. In this case, the parallels are utilised in the most optimised manner. 
<!-- **(Currently in BETA)** -->

```yaml
dynamicAllocation: true
```

***

### `collectLocalGitData`
It is a default flag which captures the git information of your repository that you have used to trigger the job in HyperExecute which are later utilized in AI-based Root Cause Analysis (RCA) generation. In order to turn off the collection of any git information after executing your HyperExecute jobs, you can define the value `false`.

```yaml
collectLocalGitData: false,
```

***

### `background`
This feature allows you to run long-running **Application Server** tasks like *"running a webapp"* or a *"my-sql database server"* in the background.

To enable this feature from the YAML file you can use either of the below mentioned methods:

#### 1. Using `backgroundDirectives`

```yaml
backgroundDirectives:
  shell: bash
  commands:
    - name: YOUR_SERVICE_NAME
      command: npx static-server
    - name: Database
      command: mysql-server
```

It contains the following attributes:

- The **`shell`** property defines the terminal it should use to run the background service.

- The **`command`** property specifies the command to be executed in the background.

- The **`name` **property specifies the name of your Background Service.

#### 2. Using `background`

```yaml
background:
  - npx static-server
  - mysql-server
```

> To learn more about it, refer to the [Background Service](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-background-services/) page.

***

###  `vars`
This method allows you to name your variables. This will make the process of modifying the YAML file easier. You can use these variables in the YAML file as &#36;&lbrace;your_variable_name&rbrace;.
Below example shows how to use vars keyword and how to use the variables define under it at other places in yaml.

```yaml
vars:
 test: e2e
 framework: net5.0
 runtime: win-x64
 testPath: ${test}\bin\build\${framework}\${runtime}
preDirectives:
 Commands:
  - echo ${framework}
```

> You can also use the vars method using the [CLI](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/#--vars).

***

### `tunnel`
Indicates whether to enable a tunnel for accessing your applications which are  locally hosted or behind a firewall. The cli will launch a tunnel as sub process if tunnel is set to true
```yaml
tunnel: true
```

***

### `tunnelOpts`
The options to use when running the [tunnel](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#tunnel).

| Options | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
|`args`| List of strings | The arguments to pass to your tunnel. For a list of arguments checkout our [tunnel flags](/support/docs/lambda-tunnel-modifiers/) |
|`preOnly`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be enabled for only the pre step. Default false. |
|`postOnly`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be enabled for only the post step. Default false. |
|`global`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be enabled for all the steps? Default true. |
|`systemProxy`| Boolean | Should the tunnel be OS system wide? Default false. |
|`checkTunnelOnFailure`| Boolean | Check tunnel on failure adds a check on our system to check the tunnel connection if a test fails and the tunnel is set to true. This option will retry the test 2 times if tunnel connection is flaky. |
|`--expose`| | This flag takes arguments in the form of `service_name:host_name_host_port`. <br /> When you trigger a test, there are environment variables exposed in the machine with the variable name :- <br /> 1. `service_name_PROXY_HOST` <br /> 2. `service_name_PROXY_PORT` |

```yaml
tunnel: true
tunnelOpts: 
	args:
	 - "--verbose"
```

```yaml
tunnel: true
tunnelOpts: 
	preOnly: true
  #------OR------
	postOnly: true
  #------OR------
	global: true
  #------OR------
	systemProxy: true
```

```yaml
pre:
  - echo %LT_PROXY_PORT%
  - echo %LT_PROXY_HOST%
  - echo %MYSQL_PROXY_HOST%
  - echo %MYSQL_PROXY_PORT%

tunnel: true
tunnelOpts:
  args: 
    - "--expose mysql:localhost:3306"
```

***

### `tunnelNames`
Specify the list of  already running tunnel names which you want to use for  accessing your applications which are locally hosted or behind a firewall.

```yaml
tunnelNames: ["lambdatest_tunnel"]
```

***

### `testRunnerExecutor`
When utilizing the `testRunnerCommand` to execute a job on a Windows Virtual Machine, the default behavior is to run the command in PowerShell. However, in situations where test names include special characters, you may encounter an error like below.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/yaml/testRunnerExecutor.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/>

To address this, it is necessary to include this specific flag to switch the test execution from powershell to the command line as intended.

```yaml
testRunnerExecutor: bat
```

***

### `workingDirectory`
<!-- Specifies the working directory where all discovery and execution commands will be executed. -->

The `working directory` specifies the location of the directory in which all test discovery and execution commands will run, as well as the location of any files or directories that are created as a result of the command execution.  If the `workingDirectory` option is not specified, then the working directory will be the directory where the YAML file is located.

```yaml
framework:
  name: maven/testng
  discoveryType: method
  workingDirectory: src/main
  flags:
    - "-Dplatname=win"
```

### `syncStart`
By default, parallel tasks in autosplit or matrix mode begin execution as soon as the VM is allocated. However, in certain situations (e.g., benchmarking or comparative analysis), you may want all VMs to start tasks at the same time.

To support this, HyperExecute provides the `syncStart` directive in the job YAML.

```yaml
execution:
  syncStart: true
```

- When `syncStart` is enabled, the job ensures that all VMs are allocated and ready before starting scenario execution i.e. tests.
- The system waits for up to 15 minutes for all required VMs to become available.
  - If all VMs are allocated within this window → tasks start together.
  - If some VMs are still pending after 15 minutes → the job proceeds with the allocated VMs.

> This feature is supported only in [`autosplit`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#autosplit) and [`matrix`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#matrix) mode and not in hybrid mode
