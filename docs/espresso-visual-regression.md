Espresso is a widely-used testing framework for Android, designed to simplify the process of writing reliable and efficient UI tests. It allows developers to create automated tests that simulate user interactions within an app, ensuring that the app's UI behaves as expected.

In this documentation, you will learn step-by-step how to perform regression testing and find Visual UI Regression bugs easily with the help of Smart Testing.

## Prerequisites

- Your LambdaTest [Username and Access key](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security).
- Access to an **Android** app (.apk) and an **Espresso Test** app (.apk file).
- Go to [`LambdaTest SmartUI`](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/) and login along with your credentials.

:::tip
If you do not have any **Android** app (.apk) and an **Android Test** app (.apk) file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/espresso/proverbial_android-app.apk) and a sample :link: [Espresso Test](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/espresso/proverbial_android_espressotest-app.apk).
:::

## Step 1: Create a SmartUI Project

The first step is to create a project with the application in which we will combine all your **builds** run on the project.
To create a SmartUI Project, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Projects page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/)
2. Click on the `new project` button
3. Select the platform as <b>Real Device </b> for executing your `Espresso` tests.
4. Add name of the project, approvers for the changes found, tags for any filter or easy navigation.
5. Click on the **Submit**.

<!-- <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/smart-ui-1.webp').default} alt="cmd" width="768" height="373" className="doc_img"/> -->

## Step 2: Set up your Authentication

Now, you need to export your environment variables LT_USERNAME and LT_ACCESS_KEY that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/details/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="bash" label="Linux / MacOS" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  {`export LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
  {`set LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Update your App Configurations

> It should be in your app configurations then only you can perform the Espresso integration.

- In your `build.gradle` file, add the [lambdatest-espresso](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.lambdatest/lambdatest-espresso) dependency:

```bash
implementation 'io.github.lambdatest:lambdatest-espresso:1.0.1'
```

- Initialize this dependency in your test classes. You can do it as follows:

```bash java
import io.github.lambdatest.LTApp;
public class BrowserTest {

  LTApp smartUIApp = new LTApp();
  
  @Test
  public void checkBrowserPageIsOpened() throws InterruptedException {
    String response = smartUIApp.screenshot("LT-Espresso-Test");
  }
}
```

Now build your application.

## Step 4: Upload your Application

To begin testing, upload your Android application (.apk file) to LambdaTest's servers. You'll use our **REST API** for this process.

- **Authentication :** You'll need your LambdaTest Username and AccessKey. Combine them in the format `Username:AccessKey`.
- **Uploading the App :** Use **cURL command** to send a request to our API. The request should include the path to your application file (**appFile**).

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="bash" label="Linux / MacOS" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  {`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" --location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/uploadFramework' --form 'appFile=@"<PATH_OF_YOUR_ANDROID_APP>"' --form 'type="espresso-android"'`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" --location --request POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/uploadFramework" --form "appFile=@"<PATH_OF_YOUR_ANDROID_APP>"" --form "type=\"espresso-android\""`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
- Provide the path of your android application in the above URL in place of `<PATH_OF_YOUR_ANDROID_APP>`
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - `lt://APP123456789123456789` and will be used in the last step.
:::

## Step 5: Upload Your Test Suite

Upload your Espresso test suite (.apk) file to LambdaTest servers using our REST API.

The following sample cURL command shows how to upload a test suite:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="bash" label="Linux / MacOS" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  {`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" --location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/uploadFramework' --form 'appFile=@"<PATH_OF_YOUR_TEST_SUITE_APP>"' --form 'type="espresso-android"'`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" --location --request POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/uploadFramework" --form "appFile=@"<PATH_OF_YOUR_TEST_SUITE_APP>"" --form "type=\"espresso-android\""`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
- Provide the path of your android application in the above URL in place of `<PATH_OF_YOUR_TEST_SUITE_APP>`
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - `lt://APP123456789123456789` and will be used in the last step.
:::

## Step 6: Executing The Test

- You will need **base64 encoded authentication** in order to execute your Espresso automation test suite. Enter your `username:accesskey` in **[Basic Authentication Header Generator](https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/api-connector-encode-credentials-to-base-64/)** to generate your auth token.

Take note of the base64 encoded authentication which needs to be added in the next step.

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
{`${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

- Once you have uploaded your app and test suite, you can execute your test by running the following command:
 
> Enter your **BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN**, **APP_ID** (generated in the fourth step) and **TEST_SUITE_ID** (generated in the fifth step) in the below command.

```javascript
curl --location 'https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/framework/v1/espresso/build' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "app": "APP_ID", //enter your app-id
    "testSuite": "TEST_SUITE_ID", //enter your test-suite id
    "device": [
        "Galaxy.*"
    ],
    "smartUI.project": "Espresso-SmartUI-Project", 
    "smartUI.build": "Espresso-SmartUI-Build", // Optional
    "smartUI.cropNavigationBar" : true, // Optional (By default false)
    "smartUI.cropStatusBar" : true, // Optional (By default true)
    "queueTimeout": 300,
    "IdleTimeout": 30,
    "deviceLog": true,
    "network": false,
    "visual": true,
    "build": "Proverbial-Espresso-Test",
    "singleRunnerInvocation": false
}'
```

## Types of Sharding
Sharding can be categorized into two types:

**Manual Sharding**: This feature enables users to manually specify shards along with their definitions, offering multiple strategies such as class, package, and more. By doing so, users can have greater flexibility and control over the sharding process.

Refer to the sample `.yaml` file here

```bash title="SampleYamlFile.yaml"
version: "0.2"
concurrency: 2
runson: android
autosplit: false
globalTimeout: 180  #MAXQUEUETIMEOUT

framework:
  name: "android/espresso"
  args:
    buildName: "Espresso"
    video: true
    deviceLog: true
    
    # You can use either the appId (lt://APP1234567) or provide the path of the application using appPath. Both examples are given below.

    #highlight-next-line
    appPath: Proverbial.apk 

    testSuitePath: ProverbialExpressoTest.apk
    # We have used the appPath and testSuitePath here. 

    
    #highlight-next-line
    appId: lt://APP1010461471690377432133206
    testSuiteAppId: lt://APP10104592261690377454846669
    # We have used the appId and testSuiteAppID here.

    deviceSelectionStrategy: all
    devices: ["Galaxy.*", "Pixel.*"]
    
    smartUI:
      project: "Espresso-SmartUI-Project"

    shards:
      mappings:
     - name: shard1
        strategy: "class"
        values: ["com.lambdatest.proverbial.BrowserTest"]
    # The strategy for this shard is based on "class".
    # This shard will run all tests from the class com.lambdatest.proverbial.BrowserTest.
     - name: shard2
       strategy: "package"
       values: ["com.lambdatest.proverbial"]
    # The strategy for this shard is based on "package". 
    # This shard will run all tests that belong to the package com.lambdatest.proverbial.l.
     - name: shard3
       strategy: "skipClass"
       values: ["com.lambdatest.proverbial.BrowserTest"]
    # The strategy for this shard is to skip a specific class. 
    # This shard will avoid running tests from the class com.lambdatest.proverbial.BrowserTest.
```


:::tip When shards are added

If you are using the `deviceSelectionStrategy: all`,then in that case all the specified shards will be executed on every device available.<br/>
**For example:** If there are 3 shards, 2 devices in list (d1, d2) and test suites contains total 10 test cases.
Then, d1 has 3 shards, i.e., total 3 devices of d1 configuration will be used. 10 test cases distributed among these 3 shards and similarly d2 also has 3 shards, i.e., total 3 devices of d2 configuration will be used. 10 test cases will be distributed among these 3 shards.

If you are using the `deviceSelectionStrategy: any`, then in that case all the mentioned shards will be executed on just one device from the provided list.<br/>
**For example:** If there are 2 shards mentioned in `.yaml`and 3 devices mentioned, the system will create 2 shards. These shards might use any 2 devices from the given 3 configurations. It's also possible that the same device configuration could be used for both shards. In this setup, test cases will be distributed between these shards.
:::

**Auto Sharding** : The system intelligently determines the distribution of tests across devices, employing specific criteria to optimize the testing process.

Refer to the sample `.yaml` file here

```bash title="SampleYamlFile.yaml"
version: "0.2"
concurrency: 2
runson: android
autosplit: true
globalTimeout: 180  #MAXQUEUETIMEOUT

framework:
  name: "android/espresso"
  args:
    buildName: "Espresso"
    video: true
    deviceLog: true
    
    # You can use either the appId (lt://APP1234567) or provide the path of the application using appPath. Both examples are given below.

    #highlight-next-line
    appPath: Proverbial.apk 

    testSuitePath: ProverbialExpressoTest.apk
    # We have used the appPath and testSuitePath here. 

    
    #highlight-next-line
    appId: lt://APP1010461471690377432133206
    testSuiteAppId: lt://APP10104592261690377454846669
    # We have used the appId and testSuiteAppID here.

    smartUI:
      project: "Espresso-SmartUI-Project"

    deviceSelectionStrategy: all
    devices: ["Galaxy.*", "Pixel.*"]

```


:::tip When shards aren't added

If you are using the `deviceSelectionStrategy: all`, then in that case the tests will be executed on all mentioned devices in `.yaml` based on the concurrency.  <br/>
**For example:** If the concurrency is 3, 2 devices in list (d1, d2) and test suites contains total 10 test cases.
Then, d1 has 3 shards, i.e., total 3 devices of d1 configuration will be used. 10 test cases distributed among these 3 shards and similarly d2 also has 3 shards, i.e., total 3 devices of d2 configuration will be used. 10 test cases will be distributed among these 3 shards.

If you are using the `deviceSelectionStrategy: any`, then in that case all the specified tests will be executed on each device from the provided list, considering the concurrency setting. <br/>
**For example:** If the concurrency is set to 2 and 3 devices mentioned, the system will create 2 shards. These shards might use any 2 devices from the given 3 configurations. It's also possible that the same device configuration could be used for both shards. In this setup, test cases will be distributed between these shards.

## Smart Crop With SmartUI

The all-new **Real Device mobile notification status bar and navigation bar crop** feature in SmartUI allows you to take your visual regression testing workflows to the next level. With Smart Crop, you can crop the status bar and navigation bar or footer from screenshots, enabling them to focus solely on the core UI elements during visual comparisons.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, it accurately detects and crops the status bar and navigation bar from screenshots. With precise image processing techniques, SmartUI precisely identifies the location of status bar elements. By excluding it from visual comparisons, the focus is solely on critical UI elements.
