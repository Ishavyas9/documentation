LambdaTest's Extended Debugging Options provide powerful capabilities to debug and optimize your Selenium tests by giving you granular control over network behavior, system performance, and diagnostic data collection. These advanced debugging features allow you to intercept and modify network requests, simulate various CPU and network conditions, capture detailed console logs, and download comprehensive network analysis filesâ€”all within your test automation workflow.

With Extended Debugging Options, you can replicate real-world scenarios such as slow networks, resource-constrained devices, API failures, and connectivity issues, ensuring your application delivers a robust user experience across diverse conditions and environments.

## How can Extended Debugging Options help you?

Extended Debugging Options on LambdaTest provide comprehensive capabilities for advanced testing and debugging scenarios:

- **Network Request Control**: Intercept and modify outgoing requests to test API failures, redirects, and mock responses without setting up complex backend infrastructure.
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate various CPU and network throttling conditions to understand how your application performs on low-end devices or poor network connections.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Capture console logs in real-time to identify JavaScript errors and warnings during test execution.
- **Network Analysis**: Download HAR (HTTP Archive) files to perform detailed analysis of network traffic, load times, and resource optimization.
- **Realistic Test Scenarios**: Create test conditions that mirror real-world user experiences, including offline modes, slow connections, and server errors.

## 1. Intercept Network Requests

The `lt:intercept` method allows you to intercept and modify network requests, enabling you to test how your application behaves under different network conditions, mock API responses, and simulate error scenarios.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | String | Yes | URL pattern to intercept. Wildcards (*) are supported. |
| `redirect` | String | No | Redirect the request to a different URL. |
| `response` | Object | No | Mock the response with custom headers and body. |
| `error` | String | No | Inject an error response. Supported values: `Failed`, `Aborted`, `TimedOut`, `AccessDenied`, etc. |

### Method 1: Redirect Requests

Redirect outgoing requests to a different URL using `lt:intercept` with the `redirect` parameter.

**Example Request:**

```json
{
    "command": "lt:intercept",
    "parameters": {
        "url": "https://example.com/api/*",
        "redirect": "https://mock-server.com/api/v1"
    }
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Requests to 'https://example.com/api/*' will be redirected to 'https://mock-server.com/api/v1'"
}
```

### Method 2: Mock Response

Mock a custom response for the intercepted URL using `lt:intercept` with the `response` parameter.

**Example Request:**

```json

            },
            "body": [{
                "title": "Test ToDo",
                "completed": false
            }]
        }
    }
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Mock response configured for 'https://example.com/api/todos'"
}
```

### Method 3: Simulate Error Response

Inject error responses to test how your application handles failures using `lt:intercept` with the `error` parameter.

**Example Request:**

## 2. Throttle CPU Performance

The `lt:throttleCPU` method simulates lower or higher CPU usage on the testing device, allowing you to measure your application's performance under resource constraints.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `rate` | Integer | Yes | Rate of slowdown. Example: `2` equals 2x slowdown, `4` equals 4x slowdown. |

```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "CPU throttled to 3x slowdown."
}
```

:::info CPU Throttling Rates
- A rate of `1` means no throttling (normal CPU performance)
- A rate of `2` means 2x slower than normal
- A rate of `4` means 4x slower than normal
- Higher values simulate lower-end devices or heavy CPU load scenarios

## Best Practices

When using Extended Debugging Options on LambdaTest, consider the following best practices:

- **Use Wildcards Wisely**: When intercepting requests, use specific URL patterns to avoid unintended interceptions.
- **Test Incrementally**: Start with mild throttling conditions and gradually increase constraints to identify performance breaking points.
- **Combine Methods**: Use multiple methods together (e.g., network throttling + CPU throttling) to simulate realistic low-end device scenarios.
- **Capture Logs Early**: Enable console log capturing at the start of your test to ensure all debug information is collected.
- **Analyze HAR Files**: Download HAR files for failed tests to identify network-related issues and performance bottlenecks.

By leveraging these Extended Debugging Options, you can create comprehensive test scenarios that validate your application's behavior under diverse real-world conditions, ensuring a robust and reliable user experience.
