**BiDi (Bi-Directional)** refers to the **WebDriver BiDi protocol**, a new standard from the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). Unlike the traditional WebDriver protocol (which works in a request ‚Üí response model), **WebDriver BiDi enables two-way communication between your test script and the browser in real time**.

That means instead of only sending commands (like ‚Äúclick this element‚Äù or ‚Äúnavigate to this URL‚Äù), your test can also **subscribe to events happening inside the browser** as they occur ‚Äî such as console logs, network requests, page lifecycle events, or JavaScript exceptions. In simple terms:
- **Old WebDriver** = One-way communication (test script sends a command, browser replies).
- **BiDi WebDriver** = Two-way communication (test script can also ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to the browser while interacting with it).

BiDi brings modern automation capabilities that were missing in Selenium until now. Some key reasons to use it:
- Real-time event monitoring
- Network interception and mocking
- Enhanced debugging
- DOM and page lifecycle tracking
- Ensures your tests are aligned with the latest W3C standards.

[HyperExecute](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-hyperexecute/) is an AI Native Test Orchestration Cloud Platform that empowers you to run **end-to-end** tests **quickly** and **efficiently**. It provides Just-in-Time (JIT) testing infrastructure with fast execution **speeds**, **smart orchestration**, and **detailed logs**.

This guide details how to execute your **BiDi** tests on **HyperExecute** using [YAML 0.1](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-parameters/)

## Run a Sample Project
### Step 1: Clone Sample Repository

:::tip BiDi repo
Download or Clone the BiDi sample from LambdaTest‚Äôs GitHub Repository

<a href="https://github.com/LambdaTest/hyperexecute-bidi-sample" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/icons/github.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/> View on GitHub</a>
:::

### Step 2: Download the CLI in your Project
Download the HyperExecute CLI and copy it into the root folder of the downloaded sample repository.

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |

### Step 3: Add the required Capabilities

> The `webSocketUrl` capability is set to `true` to enable BiDi support.

```javascript title="wdio.lambdatest.config.js"

capabilities: [{
    "LT:Options": {
      browserName: "chrome",
      // highlight-next-line
      webSocketUrl: true,
      version: "latest",
      platform: process.env.HYPEREXECUTE_PLATFORM || 'windows 10',
      name: "HyperExecute BiDi Test",
      build: "HyperExecute BiDi Test",
      console: true,
    }
}],

```

### Step 4: Configure YAML in your Test Suite

```yaml reference title="hyperexecute.yaml"
https://github.com/LambdaTest/hyperexecute-bidi-sample/blob/main/yaml/hyperexecute-linux.yaml
```

### Step 5: Execute your Test Suite
From the project root directory, execute the below CLI command in your terminal:

> **NOTE :** In case of MacOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** ‚Üí **Security & Privacy** ‚Üí **General tab**.

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
  <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
    {`./hyperexecute --user ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} --key ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()} --config yaml/hyperexecute-linux.yaml`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

### Step 6: Monitor the Test Execution

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status.
