Projects serve as a centralized platform for organizing and managing test executions. By grouping similar tests, controlling access, and tracking progress, Projects streamline the testing process. You can configure [custom project](/support/docs/hyperexecute-projects/#setup-your-project) and [workflow setups](/support/docs/hyperexecute-projects/#schedule-your-workflows), as well as [integrate Tosca, Tosca DEX, and JMeter tests](/support/docs/hyperexecute-projects/#setting-up-specialized-projects) for unified management. This enables efficient test script creation, automated execution scheduling, and valuable insights into test results.

## Link Jobs to Projects Using YAML
When you run jobs on HyperExecute, connecting them to projects helps you track performance trends, compare results over time, and get valuable insights from your test history. You can link jobs to projects in two ways using your YAML configuration file.

### Method 1: Use an Existing Project
If you already have a project in HyperExecute, follow these steps to connect your jobs to it:

1. Go to [Projects List](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/projects) tab on HyperExecute Dashboard.
2. Select and open the project you want to link your jobs to.
3. Click the copy icon next to the project name. This copies the project configuration you'll need for your YAML file.
4. Paste the copied details into your YAML file before running your job.
5. All jobs using this YAML will automatically appear in your selected project. 

The copied project detail which you need to add to the YAML will look like this:
```yaml
 project:
    name: 'demo-project' #project name
    id: '1abc2345-56de-7890-f1cg-h2ij34k56789' #project id
```

</video>

### Method 2: Create a New Project Automatically

Want to start fresh or organize jobs under a new project? You can create one directly from your YAML file. To create a new project for your job run, follow the steps given below.

1. Think of a unique name that clearly identifies what you're testing.
2. Include the project name in your YAML file in the following format.

```yaml
 project:
    name: 'unique_project_name'
```

3. All jobs using this YAML will automatically appear in your new project.

:::note
If a project with your chosen name already exists, HyperExecute will link your jobs to the existing project instead of creating new.
:::

## Setup Custom Project
**Step 1:** Go to the **Projects** section in HyperExecute. Click on the **New Project** to create your projects on HyperExecute.

**Step 2:** SelectÂ **Custom Project** as theÂ **Type of Project**. Provide a unique **Project Name** (required) and select your desired framework and language used in your project. Click on the **Continue**.

**Step 3:** Provide your **GitHub URL** and the **[Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)** / **Bitbucket URL** and the **[Repository Access Tokens](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/repository-access-tokens/)** of your repository. You can also add your team members as **Co-Owners** to allow them to edit or delete the project alongside you.

:::info important
Currently, only **GitHub** and **Bitbucket** repositories are supported.
:::

Click on **Save** button to finish the setup of your project.

## Schedule your Workflows
Within each HyperExecute Project, you can set up one or more workflows. These workflows allow for scheduled execution of your tests, providing you with the flexibility to automate your testing process according to your development and release cycles.

> **NOTE :** Currently, it works only in the [dynamic mode of testÂ discovery](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#testdiscovery).

**Step 1:** Click on the **Setup Workflow**. Enter your workflow name, provide your branch name and then enter the path of your YAML file you want to execute. Click on **Next**.

**Step 2:** Configure the schedule of your workflow. Select the **days** and **time** at which you want to trigger your tests. Click on **Next**.

**Step 3: Workflow Linking (Optional)-** You can connect this workflow to other existing workflows in this project or others that you own. When this workflow is completed successfully, it can automatically activate the linked workflows. To configure this, select the workflows you want to trigger from the list of existing workflows. This feature enables you to create automated workflow chains for more complex testing and deployment processes.

> ðŸ“˜ Gain a Comprehensive Understanding of how to use connected workflows to create [Test Chains](/support/docs/hyperexecute-test-chains/).

**Workflow Variables(Optional) -** Workflow Variables allow you to customize a workflowâ€™s behavior without modifying the underlying YAML configuration. This makes it easy to reuse the same workflow across multiple environments or scenarios by simply providing different values at runtime.

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Define variables at workflow level:** You can add variables when creating or editing a workflow. Each variable requires a key, while the value is optional.
- **Multiple values per variable:** A key can hold multiple values. The first value is marked as the default, and all values are stored as comma-separated options.
- **Runtime overrides:** When you run a workflow, a pop-up displays the workflowâ€™s default variables. You can edit them or provide values for empty variables before execution. These runtime changes apply only to the current run and do not overwrite saved defaults.
- **Case sensitivity:** Variable keys are case-sensitive.
- **Priority:** Runtime values override workflow-level defaults during execution.

#### Example Use Cases:
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=staging` or `ENVIRONMENT=production` without maintaining separate YAML files.
- Define `BROWSER=chrome,firefox,safari` at the workflow level, then select or override a browser at runtime.
- Leave `API_KEY` empty by default and provide it securely at runtime.

#### Limits:
- Up to **100 variables per workflow**.
- Each variable supports up to **25 values**.
- Maximum size per workflowâ€™s variable set: **512 KB**.
- Each value can be up to **500 characters** (excluding commas/spaces).

**Access Control:** Permissions for editing workflow variables follow the same role-based access model as secrets.


Click on the **Finish** button and your job will be triggered on the defined day and time.
