# KaneAI Command Guide

KaneAI offers a **natural language interface** for authoring test steps. Each step is expressed as an instruction that KaneAI translates into executable automation. With KaneAAI supported commands you can build **clear, dynamic, and human-readable test cases**.

## üîó Navigation & Page Interaction


| Action       | Example Commands                               |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Open URL     | `go to https://example.com`  ,  `open https://example.com` |
| Click        | `click on login button`                        |
| Type Text    | `enter "user@example.com"`  ,  `type "password123"` |
| Clear Field  | `clear email input field`                      |
| Select Date  | `select 21st september date`                   |
| Hover        | `hover on shop by category option`             |
| Search       | `search for "laptop"`                          |
| Refresh      | `refresh the page`                             |
| Navigation   | `go back`  ,   `navigate back`  ,  `go forward`  ,  `navigate forward` |


## ‚è± Waits & Timeouts

### Default Wait
Every element interaction automatically includes a **default wait of 10 seconds** for the element to become interactable.

### Explicit Waits
Define timeouts explicitly using natural language instruction like  ` wait for 5 seconds `

### Custom Timeouts
You can override waits per step via the UI:
1. Click step menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí **Step Timeout**
2. Enter timeout value **(seconds, max 300)**

:::note
Custom waits apply only to element-based interactions.

## üìë Tab Management

- `open new lambdatest tab`  
- `switch to 2nd tab` / `switch to lambdatest tab`  
- `close lambdatest tab` / `close 2nd tab`

---

## üìú Scrolling

- `scroll until the button is visible`
- `scroll by 100px`
- `scroll to the bottom` / `scroll to the top`
- `scroll 3 times`
- `scroll by 20 percent`

:::tip
Use `scroll until` for elements not yet visible in the viewport. Works for entire pages and scrollable subsections.  
:::

---

## ‚úÖ Assertions

Assertions validate expected outcomes. KaneAI supports several categories:

| Category | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Driver Assertions** | Validate **browser state** (URL, dimensions).<ul><li>Assert if current URL is `https://example.com`</li><li>Validate window height and width</li></ul> |
| **Text Assertions** | Check for **presence/absence of text**.<ul><li>Assert ‚ÄúWelcome Back!‚Äù is visible</li><li>Assert error message ‚ÄúInvalid password‚Äù is displayed</li></ul> |
| **Visual Assertions** | Confirm **image or logo visibility**.<ul><li>Assert company logo appears in header</li><li>Assert product image is visible</li></ul> |
| **Relative Assertions** | Validate **element relationships**.<ul><li>Assert login button is in same column as username</li><li>Assert submit & cancel buttons are in same row</li></ul> |
| **Mathematical Assertions** | Check **numeric calculations**.<ul><li>Assert `3 + 4 = 7`</li></ul> |

:::note
Since **July 20, 2025**, all assertions fail tests immediately by default.  
Older tests may still use *warn-and-continue* until edited.

## üöß Unsupported (Coming Soon)

The following assertion types are not yet available:

| Category | Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Element State** | Assert if submit button is disabled | Directly acessing the element state is not supported. | 
| **Element Property** | Assert if font size is 16px | Directly acessing the element properties is not supported. |
| **Spatial** | Assert the 5th column of the table contains "Jordan.Mathews" | This requires to deep knowledge of DOM to understand the possitions & arrangements of the elements. 
| **Logical** | Assert user is admin AND logged in | Assertions combining multiple conditions. | 
| **Action-based** | Assert tooltip appears after hover | Assertion after an action is performed. *These types of instructions can be broken into multiple steps & executed as for now.* |
| **Nested Assertions** | Assert login button enabled AND welcome message visible | Nested assertions involve multiple layers of validation within a single assertion. |

---

## üîç Query Information
- `query the current url`
- `query the time mentioned in the poster`

---

## üîÑ Conditional Actions

### Conditional Click
`if pop up is present in the viewport then click on it`

### Conditional Selection
`if price < 200 then click add to cart else select second product`

## Do's and Don'ts

| **Do (Good Example)**                                             | **Don‚Äôt (Bad Example)**                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Assert text "Submit" on form footer is visible`                  | `Assert that the submit button works and the layout is correct`                        |
| `Assert textbox contains the exact value 'heading1'`              | `Assert the textbox has heading` (vague, unclear what ‚Äúheading‚Äù refers to)             |
| `Assert logo is visible`  `Assert 3 search results are shown` | `Assert logo is visible and 3 results are shown` (too many assertions in one)          |
| Use: `Assert search results appear` after a wait step             | `Wait for search results and then assert they are visible` (assertion contains action) |
| `Assert the divider looks red`                                    | `Assert divider color is #ff5733` (too detail‚Äëspecific, fragile visual check)          |
| `Assert no text in table overflows its cell`                      | `Assert the page looks well designed` (subjective, unclear)                            |

## üåü Best Practices
- Write **clear, specific** commands
- Combine command types for richer tests
- Use **conditional logic** for dynamic flows
- Apply waits thoughtfully for stability
- Always add assertions to validate outcomes
