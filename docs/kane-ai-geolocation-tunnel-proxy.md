Now you can start your web tests on Kane AI using advanced configurations like geolocation, tunnel, and dedicated proxy support.

## Geolocation Support

With KaneAI's geolocation feature, you can simulate user interactions from different regions to ensure your website works as expected worldwide.

### Steps to Use Geolocation

**Step 1 :** Select the **Geolocation** option from the **Advanced Settings** and choose your desired region.

**Step 2 :** Run your web test on KaneAI with traffic proxied through the selected region.

**Step 3 :** Once the test is saved, the generated code will include geolocation details automatically, making it easier to 
replicate the test across different regions.

## Tunnel Support

KaneAI also supports tunneling to allow you to test websites hosted locally or behind a firewall.

### Steps to Use Tunnel

**Step 1 :** Configure the tunnel using the [LT tunnel binary](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/#lambdatest-tunnel-guide) with `--env ht-prod` mode enabled. You can use the following command to trigger your tunnel:

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
<CodeBlock className="language-bash">
{`./LT --user ${YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} --key ${YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}  --env ht-prod -v -n TUNNEL_NAME`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

**Step 2 :** Select the tunnel from the **Advanced Settings** on KaneAI and choose the tunnel that you have spun up.

**Step 3 :** Run your web test on KaneAI from a locally hosted webpage.

**Step 4 :** Once the test is saved, the generated code will include tunnel details automatically for easy replication.

## Dedicated Proxy Support (Enterprise only)

KaneAI offers support for dedicated proxy usage, exclusively available for enterprise accounts with dedicated proxy enabled.

### Steps to Use Dedicated Proxy

**Step 1 :** Select the **Dedicated Proxy** option from the **Advanced Settings** and choose the region.

**Step 2 :** Run your web test on KaneAI with traffic routed through the dedicated proxy IP configured for your organization.

**Step 3 :** Once the test is saved, the generated code will include proxy details automatically, allowing seamless future executions.
