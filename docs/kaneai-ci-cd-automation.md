This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for automating the execution of test runs using CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins on the KaneAI platform. By following these steps, you can effortlessly integrate test run executions with your pipelines.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Test Manager.
- A project with KaneAI-generated test cases.
- Credentials for LambdaTest platform.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Navigate to the Test Manager
- Log in to the KaneAI platform and go to the Test Manager page.
- Access the project where the test run is located.

### Step 2: Locate the 'Test Runs' Section & Copy Test run ID
Inside your selected project, navigate to the Test Runs section. Select the desired test run for integration or direct triggering from your CI/CD pipeline.

Open the test run to view its URL. Copy the Test Run ID from the URL. This ID will be used in the API call for integration.

:::tip
A list of test instances with various configurations will be displayed for each test run.
:::


### Step 3: Configure the API Call
Replace `<TestRunID>` with the actual ID from the URL and set additional optional parameters:

- **concurrency**: Select the concurrency you want to set for this test run. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
- **title**: Assign a unique job title; a random one will be generated if omitted.
- **region**: Choose a region for web tests such as _eastus_ or _centralindia_ to select the region from where the VM is allocated.
- **mobile_region**: Choose a region for mobile app tests such as _us_,_ap_ or _eu_ to select the region from where the device is allocated.
- **tunnel**: Add the parameter and tunnel name if you want to run using LambdaTest Tunnel for private applications. See more details for tunnel [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/kane-ai-geolocation-tunnel-proxy/#tunnel-support).
- **dedicated_proxy**: Add the region of the dedicated proxy such as _us_ or _eu_, #Optional, either tunnel or dedicated proxy or geolocation can be used in a single API call.
- **geolocation**: Add the resgion of the geolocation that you want to run your tests from. You can find the list of support geolocations [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/selenium-geolocation-capabilities/).
- **environment_id**: Define the environment on which you want to run the test run if required.
- **retry_on_failure**: Define whether to retry if the [testRunnerCommand](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#testrunnercommand) execution fails. If "retry_on_failure" is false, the default max retries will still be 1. You can find more details [here]( https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#retryonfailure).
- **max_retries**: Define the number of maximum retries you want (Max value 5). Default retries 1. You can find more details [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#maxretries). 
- **timezone**: Define the timezone you want to choose for test run in UTC+01:00 format.
- **app_profiling**: Add true if you want to track app profiling metrics in your test. You can find more details [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-app-performance-analytics/).
- **performance**: Add true if you want generate Lighthouse report for your web tests. Supported on limited OS browser combinations. Additionally, Setting this as true could potentially slow down the execution time. You can find more details [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/view-lighthouse-performance-metrics/).
- **android_app_id**: Specify an Android app ID to override the existing app in the configuration of the Test instances.
- **ios_app_id**: Specify an iOS app ID to override the existing app in the configuration of the Test instances.
- **accessibility**: Set as true if you want to run accessibility test on all your tests in the test run. Setting this as true could potentially slow down the execution time.
- **replaced_url :** To be used to dynamically replace any pattern URL in test cases with the replacement URL for entire test run.

#### Sample API Response:

The API response contains the job ID for both jobs created for desktop web tests as well as mobile tests on real devices. Here is a sample response for a test run which contains both app and web test cases:

```yaml
{
    "job_id": "abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234",
    "app_job_id": "abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234",
    "test_run_id": "01LAMBDATEST2024KANEAIJ8NPGDP",
    "job_link": "https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/task?jobId=<job_id>",
    "mobile_job_link": "https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/task?jobId=<app_job_id>"
}
```


### Step 4: Authenticate and Trigger the Job
- Provide your LambdaTest username and access key for Basic Authentication.
- Submit the API call to trigger the job. The process will start within seconds.

> **Important :** Keep your credentials secure to maintain platform integrity.


### Step 5: Monitor Test Executions
- Follow the link provided in the API response to view the HyperExecute Job.
- Monitor running executions in real time through the dashboard.

## GithubActions sample
Here is a sample that you can use on how to integrate the API with GithubActions in your Github repository:

**Step 1: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow YAML File**
In your Git repository, navigate to .github/workflows/ and create a file named sanity-test.yml.

**Step 2: Sample for yml file**
In below sample, we are executing a test run using test_run_id and then verifying the result for it using HyperExecute job status API. You can find more details on HyperExecute APIs [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/api-doc/?key=hyperexecute) and update the API in the .yml file based on your needs.

```yml
name: Run Sanity Tests on LambdaTest

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sanity-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Trigger Sanity Test on LambdaTest
        id: trigger-test
        run: |
          echo "Triggering sanity tests on LambdaTest"
          response=$(curl --location 'https://test-manager-api.lambdatest.com/api/atm/v1/hyperexecute' \
            --header 'accept: application/json' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --header 'Authorization: Basic <Base64Auth>' \
            --data '{
                "test_run_id" : "<test_run_id>",
                "concurrency" : 1,
            }')
          echo "Response: $response"
          job_id=$(echo $response | jq -r '.job_id')
          echo "Job ID: $job_id"
          echo "::set-output name=job_id::$job_id"
      
      - name: Check Test Status
        run: |
          echo "Checking test status"
          job_id=${{ steps.trigger-test.outputs.job_id }}
          sleep 240  # Wait before checking the status
          response=$(curl --location "https://api.hyperexecute.cloud/v2.0/job/$job_id" \
            --header "accept: application/json" \
            --header "Authorization: Basic <Base64Auth>")
            
          echo "Response: $response"
          status=$(echo $response | jq -r '.data.status')
          echo "Test status: $status"
          if [[ "$status" != "completed" ]]; then
            echo "Tests failed. Exiting with error."
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "Sanity tests passed successfully."
```

**Step 3: Define Workflow Triggers**
Set the workflow to trigger on push and pull_request events (you can modify the trigger based on your needs) under "on" section of the yaml above.
