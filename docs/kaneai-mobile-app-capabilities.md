> This document provides detailed instructions for utilizing advanced features in KaneAI's mobile app authoring. It covers enabling video and image injections, configuring biometrics, and other advanced settings to enhance test authoring.

## Introduction

KaneAI's mobile app authoring support various advanced capabilities for authoring mobile app tests. Users can navigate to advanced settings to enable options such as disabling screenshot block, enabling biometric authentication, image injection, and video injection for creating tests within KaneAI.

## Disable Screenshot Block

If your app doesn't allow screenshot to be taken of the app and you want to test your app's performance without any hindrance, you can use this capability. It will disable the screenshot block check added in the application to allow authoring test cases in LambdaTest.

You need to ensure to enable it from advanced settings before authoring your test on KaneAI. You can find more details about this capability [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/disable-screenshot-block/).

## Biometrics Authentication

Biometric Authentication is a security process that leverages the unique biological characteristics of individuals to verify their identities. In native applications, it is often used to provide a seamless, secure, and efficient user experience. This capability allows you to test your application's biometric authentication functionality more accurately and ensures your app provides an optimal user experience across a range of devices and platforms.

You can find more details about this capability [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/biometric-authentication/).&#x20;

## Image Injection

Camera Image Injection feature allows you to author tests withÂ **image capturing, QR code scanning**, andÂ **barcode scanning**Â functionalities in your app acrossÂ **real devices**Â on the LambdaTest.

You need to ensure to enable it from advanced settings before authoring your test on KaneAI. Once enabled, you will get an option to inject image in "slash" commands in-session which needs to be used before you select the option to trigger camera API in your application workflow.

You can find more details about this capability [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/camera-image-injection/).

## Video Injection

Video Injection feature enables you to test video-based functionalities such asÂ **live streaming, real-time video capture,**Â andÂ **video processing** in your app acrossÂ **real devices**Â on the LambdaTest.

You need to ensure to enable it from advanced settings before authoring your test on KaneAI. Once enabled, you will get an option to inject video in "slash" commands in-session which needs to be used before you select the option to trigger camera API in your application workflow.

You can find more details about this capability [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/video-injection/).
