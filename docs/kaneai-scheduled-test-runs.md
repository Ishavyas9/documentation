In this documentation, you will learn how to create a scheduled test run using pre-existing test runs. This involves navigating through your project, selecting test configurations, and setting up recurring schedules to automate test executions at specified times.

**Step 1:** Navigate to **Test Manager** >> select your desired project >> **Test Runs** section.

**Step 2:** Here, you will see the details of your existing test runs. To create a schedule, click on the three dots next to a test run and select **Create Schedule**. Alternatively, you can go to the **Scheduled runs** section to view all existing schedules. If you don't have any existing schedule, click on **Create a Scheduled Run** button to create a scheduled run.

> Test Runs must be created before creating a test run schedule.

**Step 3:** Provide the details related to the test you want to schedule, like **Schedule Name**, select existing test run you want to schedule, and configure the date and time details.

**Step 5:** In the **Build Parameters** box, you can define your desired concurrency for the tests. Click on the **Advanced Configurations** button to configure settings like network logs, console settings, or accessibility testing. If necessary, [replace URL settings](/support/docs/kaneai-dynamic-url-replacement/). Finally, click **Schedule Test Run** to create a recurring schedule.

**Step 6:** Click on any existing schedule to view detailed information, including a summary of test outcomes, passed and failed cases, and their respective instances. This helps in easily reviewing and proceeding with the tests.
