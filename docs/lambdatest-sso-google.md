# LambdaTest SSO Integration with Google Workspace

* * *

LambdaTest provides seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with Google Workspace, enabling your team to access LambdaTest using their existing Google credentials. This integration streamlines user management and enhances security by centralizing authentication through your Google Workspace identity provider.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through configuring SAML-based SSO between your LambdaTest organization and Google Workspace, ensuring a smooth and secure authentication experience for your team.

## Prerequisites

* * *

Before configuring SSO integration, ensure you have the following:

*   **LambdaTest Enterprise Plan**: SSO functionality is available with our Enterprise subscription. Learn more about [managing your subscription](/docs/manage-subscriptions/).
*   **LambdaTest Organization Admin Access**: You must have administrative privileges within your LambdaTest organization to configure SSO settings.
*   **Google Workspace Super Admin Access**: Administrative access to your organization's Google Workspace instance is required to create and configure SAML applications.

## Configuration Guide

* * *

The SSO integration process involves configuring both Google Workspace and LambdaTest. We'll guide you through each step to ensure a successful setup.

### Step 1: Create SAML App in Google Workspace

1. **Access Google Admin Console**: Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/) using a super administrator account. This level of access is required to create and configure SAML applications.
