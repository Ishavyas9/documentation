# Network Logs and Configurations

Network logs record every network interaction during your test session, from API calls and page requests to server responses and load times. These logs are stored in HAR format, giving you a complete snapshot of **network performance** for each run. By reviewing this data, you can identify slow endpoints, troubleshoot failed requests, and validate that your app communicates with the right services—all without leaving your testing workflow.

On LambdaTest, you can enable **network configurations** to capture and analyze this traffic in real time on real devices. With flexible options such as content capture and domain-based filtering, you can focus on the most relevant network interactions while reducing noise from unrelated requests. This helps ensure faster debugging, clearer insights, and more efficient test runs.

## Use Cases


- **Debug API calls** by viewing HTTP/S request and response data directly from real device sessions.
- **Verify backend integration** by checking if calls are made to the correct endpoints.
- **Filter noise** by including/excluding specific hosts.
- **Reproduce production issues** that depend on specific network conditions or API behaviors.

## Capabilities

| Capability                  | Type                   | Default | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **network**                 | Boolean                | true   | Enables network logs for the session.                        |

---

## Network Configuration Settings
To enable the following you would need to pass them under `networkLogsOptions` Capability.

| Network Configurations Capability | Type                   | Default | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **captureContent**          | Boolean                | true    | Captures the response body in network logs.                  |
| **networkLogsExcludeHosts** | String                 | None    | Hosts to exclude from network logs.                          |
| **networkLogsIncludeHosts** | String                 | None    | Only capture network logs for these hosts; all others will be excluded. |


:::info
- `networkLogsExcludeHosts` and `networkLogsIncludeHosts` are mutually exclusive. If both are set, **IncludeHosts** takes precedence.

## Managing Certificate Pinning in Network Logs

Some mobile apps add an extra layer of security by using **certificate pinning** — a process where the app is hard-coded to trust only a specific certificate or public key for certain hosts. This means that whenever the app communicates with those hosts, it **verifies the server’s certificate** against its pinned copy before allowing the connection.

When you enable **network logging** on LambdaTest, traffic passes through a **secure proxy** so requests and responses can be captured. For **certificate-pinned hosts**, this interception may cause the connection to fail because the certificate no longer matches exactly. To avoid such issues, you can exclude pinned hosts from being proxied by adding them to the `networkLogsExcludeHosts` capability. This ensures your tests run smoothly without breaking **secure connections**.

## Network Configurations in Automation Test

### Step 1: Upload Your App to LambdaTest

Before enabling network configurations, ensure your app is uploaded to LambdaTest.

1. **Uploading Your App** – Follow the detailed steps in our [Upload Your Application](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/upload-your-application/) guide.
2. Once uploaded, **note the App ID** returned by the API or dashboard.
3. Use this **App ID** in the `"app"` capability in your automation script.

### Step 2: Add Desired Capabilities

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>
    <CodeBlock className="language-java">
{`desired_caps = {
    "deviceName": "Galaxy S20",
    "platformName": "Android",
    "platformVersion": "15",
    "isRealMobile": True,
    "app": "YOUR_APP_ID",
    "build": "Sample Build",
    "name": "Sample Test",
    "network": True,
    #highlight-next-line
    "networkLogsOptions": {
        "captureContent": False,
        "excludeHosts": ["lambdatest"],
        "includeHosts": ["youtube", "facebook"]
    },
}`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">
    <CodeBlock className="language-java">
{`desired_caps = {
    "deviceName": "iPhone 16",
    "platformName": "ios",
    "platformVersion": "18",
    "isRealMobile": True,
    "app": "YOUR_APP_ID",
    "build": "Sample Build",
    "name": "Sample Test",
    "network": True,
    #highlight-next-line
    "networkLogsOptions": {
        "captureContent": False,
        "excludeHosts": ["lambdatest"],
        "includeHosts": ["youtube", "facebook"]
    },
}`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Run Your Test
Execute your test script using your preferred automation framework with the above capabilities.

## Best Practices

- **Exclude analytics/tracking domains** to reduce log noise.
- For **certificate-pinned apps**, always add pinned hosts to `networkLogsExcludeHosts`.
- Use **networkLogsIncludeHosts** for focused debugging when investigating specific endpoints.
- Keep `captureContent: false` if you only need headers for performance gains.

---

:::tip
- **Certificate-pinned apps** may fail if pinned hosts are not excluded.
- Available only on **Pro Plan**.
- Certain HTTPS connections (e.g., using custom certificate pinning) cannot be intercepted even with MITM.
