This document guides you through setting up and using the LambdaTest Playwright-Node.js SDK to run your Playwright tests on the LambdaTest platform.

## Overview
The LambdaTest Playwright Node SDK is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of running your existing Playwright tests on the LambdaTest cloud grid. It eliminates the need for code modifications and provides a simple, configuration-driven approach to test execution.

Key benefits include:

*   **Effortless Execution**: Run your entire test suite on the LambdaTest platform with a single, simple command. The SDK handles all the underlying complexity of connecting to the grid.
*   **Zero Code Changes**: Integrate your existing Playwright tests without modifying your test scripts. All configuration is managed externally in the lambdatest.yml file.
*   **Centralized Capabilities**: Define and manage all your test environments—including browser, platform, and resolution combinations—in a single, easy-to-read YAML file.
*   **Local & Private Testing**: Seamlessly test internal, pre-production, or locally hosted websites using the LambdaTest Tunnel, which can be managed automatically by the SDK.
*   **CI/CD Integration**: The command-line nature of the SDK makes it trivial to integrate into any CI/CD pipeline (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.) for continuous testing.
*   **Rich Test Artifacts**: All test runs are automatically reported to your LambdaTest Dashboard, complete with video recordings, step-by-step screenshots, browser logs, and network logs for easy debugging.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following requirements are met:

*   A LambdaTest account. A free account can be created at [LambdaTest - AI Powered Testing Tool | AI Testing Agents On Cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/signup).
*   Your LambdaTest username and access key, which are available in your [LambdaTest profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).
*   A local installation of Node.js and npm.
*   An existing Playwright project.

## Installation

To get started, install the SDK as a development dependency within your project's root directory.

```bash
npm install @lambdatest/playwright-node-sdk
```

## Configuration

The SDK is configured via a `lambdatest.yml` file located in your project root. This YAML file orchestrates your test execution, defining credentials, capabilities, and other run settings.

### 1. Initializing the Configuration File

You can generate a template `lambdatest.yml` file by running the following command. You may also provide an optional filename.

```bash
npx playwright-node-sdk --init [(optional: filename)]
```

Below is the structure and explanation of the configuration options available in the `lambdatest.yml` file.

```yaml
# Access your LambdaTest credentials from https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security/username-accesskey
# It's recommended to use environment variables for your credentials.
user: {YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME}
accessKey: {YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY}

# Build name for your test run
build: "Playwright Node.js SDK Build"

# Name of the test suite
name: "Playwright Test Suite"

# Global base configuration
framework: "playwright" # Framework name
source: "node-js-playwright-sample-sdk:v1" # GitHub branch and tag

# Optional: Build and project tags for organization and filtering
buildTags: ["playwright", "nodejs", "typescript"]
tags: ["smoke", "regression"]
projectName: "Playwright Node SDK Testing"

# Define the number of parallel sessions for each configuration
# Check your parallel session limits at https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/subscriptions
parallelsPerPlatform: 2

# Optional: Advanced settings applied to all tests
network: false # To capture network HAR logs (may impact test execution speed)
console: false # To capture browser console logs (may impact test execution speed)
video: true # To capture video for debugging (may impact test execution speed)
tunnel: false # To test pages behind a VPN/private network or from a local system. Refer to https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/
dedicatedProxy: false
idleTimeout: 300
timezone: "UTC"
visual: true # To capture a screenshot for each command (may impact test execution speed)
headless: false # To run tests in headless mode. Note: Video will not be available for headless tests.
commandLog: true # To capture commands that are executed on the LambdaTest platform
resolution: "1280x960" # To set the global resolution/viewport size to execute tests

# Tunnel-specific tests
tunnel_settings:
  # tunnel: true
  # autostart: true
  # tunnelName: "app-behind-firewall-localhost-test-tunnel"
  # localdirectory: "./log"
  # verbose: true
  # loglevel: "debug"

# Global Playwright configuration (inherited by all platforms unless overridden)
playwrightConfigOptions:
  testDir: "tests"
  # use:
  #   viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }

# Refer to the capability generator for detailed configurations: https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/
platforms:
  - platform: "macOS Sequoia" # Or "Windows 11", "android", "ios"
    browserName: "chrome" # Or pw-firefox, pw-webkit
    # You can specify an exact browser version or use "latest", "latest-1", etc.
    browserVersion: "latest"
    # For mobile testing
    # deviceName: "Pixel 7" # Or "iPhone 14"
    # platformVersion: "13" # Or "16"
    # isRealMobile: true
    # ltOptions:
    #   Geolocation-specific tests
    #   geoLocation: "GB"
    #   Network communication tests (enable network logging)
    #   network: true
    #   console: true
    #   fullHar: true # To capture request and response body (might slow the test execution)
    # playwrightConfigOptions:
    #   testDir: "additional-tests"
    #   testMatch: ["**/mobile-responsive.spec.ts"]
    #   # For mobile testing
    #   use:
    #     viewport: { width: 390, height: 844 }
```

### 2. Credentials Configuration

In the `lambdatest.yml` file, replace the placeholder values for `user` and `accessKey` with your LambdaTest credentials.

### 3. Platform Configuration

The `platforms` array defines the target environments (OS/browser combinations) for your test execution. You can specify multiple platform objects. For a complete list of valid platform configurations, consult the [LambdaTest Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).

### 4. Run Settings

The `run_settings` section is not explicitly present in the provided YAML, but you can control test execution behavior by passing standard Playwright CLI arguments directly to the `playwright-node-sdk` command.

### 5. Playwright Project Options

The `playwrightConfigOptions` section provides a powerful mechanism to override your project's native Playwright configuration for the LambdaTest run. This allows for dynamic adjustments without altering your source `playwright.config.js`.

*   **testDir**: Specifies the location of your test files.

    ```yaml
    playwrightConfigOptions:
      testDir: './tests'
    ```

*   **testMatch** and **testIgnore**: Defines glob patterns to include or exclude specific test files from the run.

    ```yaml
    playwrightConfigOptions:
      testMatch: /.*\.e2e\.js/
      testIgnore: /.*\.spec\.js/
    ```

*   **setup** and **teardown**: Specifies scripts to be executed before and after your test suite.

    ```yaml
    playwrightConfigOptions:
      setup:
        - name: 'setup1'
          testMatch: '**/*.setup.ts'
          teardown: 'teardown1'
      teardown:
        - name: 'teardown1'
          testMatch: '/teardown\.ts/'
    ```

*   **use**: Sets global options that are applied to all tests within the run.

    ```yaml
    playwrightConfigOptions:
      use:
        baseURL: 'https://www.example.com'
    ```

### 6. Tunnel Configuration

The `tunnel_settings` section is used for testing applications that are not publicly accessible (e.g., on localhost or behind a firewall).

*   **tunnel: true**: Enables the LambdaTest Tunnel feature.
*   **autostart: true**: Instructs the SDK to automatically manage the tunnel's lifecycle (start and stop).

## Running Your Tests

To execute your tests on the LambdaTest platform, you will use the `playwright-node-sdk` CLI wrapper followed by the standard `playwright test` command.

```bash
npx playwright-node-sdk playwright test --config Optional path-of-config.yml
```

### Execution Workflow

When this command is run, the SDK performs the following steps:

1.  Reads and parses the `lambdatest.yml` configuration file.
2.  If `tunnel: true` and `autostart: true` are set, it establishes a secure connection via the LambdaTest Tunnel.
3.  Generates a temporary, in-memory Playwright configuration that includes the necessary hooks to connect to the LambdaTest grid.
4.  Executes your Playwright tests using this temporary configuration.
5.  Upon test completion, it terminates the LambdaTest Tunnel (if started) and cleans up any temporary artifacts.

You can pass any standard Playwright CLI options directly to this command. For instance, to run a specific test file:

```bash
npx playwright-node-sdk playwright test tests/my-test.spec.js
